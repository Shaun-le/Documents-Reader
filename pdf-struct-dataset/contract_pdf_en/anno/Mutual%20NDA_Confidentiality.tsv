this Agreement, or sooner if so requested by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will return to the	0	c
Disclosing Party or destroy all Confidential Information, including all copies of the same.  Upon request,	0	c
the  fact  of  any  such  destruction  must  be  certified  in writing  to  the  Disclosing  Party  by  an  officer  of  the	0	c

Disclosing  Party  may  seek  an  appropriate  protective  order  or  other  relief.    In  any  case,  such  Receiving	0	c
Party will (a) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Party’s legal	0	c
counsel advises is required to be disclosed, (b) use best efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information	0	c

protect the other party against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, and, without prejudice to	0	c
any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the parties hereto, agrees to the granting of injunctive	0	c
relief in favor of the other without proof of irreparable harm or the posting of any bond.  In the event of	0	c
litigation commenced by a party to enforce this Agreement, the primarily prevailing party will be entitled	0	c
to recover its costs and expenses in such litigation, including attorneys’ fees and expenses.	0	c
8.      Transaction.  Both parties agree that unless and until final, written definitive agreements	0	c
regarding a specific transaction between the parties have been executed and delivered, neither party will be	0	c
under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to extend or expand the relationship beyond the Purpose	0	c
of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.	0	s

10.    Miscellaneous.    This  Agreement  will  inure  to  the  benefit  of  and  be  binding  upon  the	0	c
parties’  respective  successors  and  permitted  assigns.    Neither  party  may  assign  this  Agreement  or  any	0	c
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not	0	c
be unreasonably withheld.  Both parties agree not to issue or release any articles, advertising, publicity or	0	c
other matter relating to the existence of this Agreement or any Confidential Information (including the fact	0	c
that a meeting or discussion has taken place between the parties) or mentioning or implying the name of	0	c
the  other  party,  except  as  may  be  required  by  law  and  then  only  after  providing  the  other  party  with  an	0	c
opportunity to review and comment thereon.  In the event that any one of the provisions contained in this	0	c
Agreement  is  found  to  be  invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable  in  any  respect  by  a  court  of  competent	0	c
jurisdiction, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions contained in this Agreement	0	c
will  not  in  any  way  be  affected  or  impaired  by  such  a  finding.    No  waiver  of  any  provisions  of  this	0	c
Agreement will be valid unless the same is in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is	0	c
sought.  A waiver or consent given by either party on any one occasion is effective only in that instance	0	c
and  will  not  be  construed  as  a  bar  to  or  waiver  of  any  right  on  any  other  occasion.    This  Agreement	0	c
contains  the  entire  agreement  of  the  parties,  supersedes  any  and  all  prior  agreements,  written  or  oral,	0	c
between them relating to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended unless agreed to in writing by	0	c
each party.  The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are in addition to, not in lieu of,	0	c
all  rights  and  obligations  under  applicable  statutory  and  common  law  with  respect  to  the  other’s	0	c
Confidential Information.  This Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of	0	c
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without regard to its conflict of laws provisions).	-1	s
