1. "Confidential Information"means information that relates to the Purpose (as defined below) or that, although not related to	0	c
such Purpose, is nevertheless disclosed as a result of the parties' discussions in that regard, and that should reasonably have been	0	c
understood by the party receiving such information (the “Recipient”), because of legends or other markings, the circumstances of	0	c
disclosure or the nature of the information itself, to be proprietary and confidential to the party disclosing the information (the	0	c
“Discloser”) or an Affiliate of the Discloser or to a third party. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other	0	c
tangible form (including on electronic media) or by oral, visual or other means. Confidential Information includes all of the	0	c
following, whether or not reduced to tangible form: software codes and computer programs; trade secrets, patents, patent	0	c
applications, and copyrights; know-how, processes, research, development, ideas, and inventions (whether patentable or not);	0	c
formulas and algorithms; technical drawings, schematics, design, diagrams, models, and flow charts; documentation and	0	c
specifications; databases and materials; financial information and projections; business plans and needs; employee information;	0	c
customer lists, sales information and forecasts, marketing plans, customer leads, customer information and anticipated markets;	0	c
and other information of a similar nature, and any other trade secrets or non-public business information belonging or	0	c
pertaining to either of the parties. "Affiliate"means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under	0	c
common control with a party.	0	s
2. Recipient will not use any Confidential Information except to the extent necessary for the internal purpose of discussing,	0	c
analyzing, and exchanging information about each party’s products, services and other offerings to determine whether the	0	c
parties may enter into a mutually beneficial business relationship (“Purpose”). Recipient will not disseminate or disclose any	0	c
Confidential Information to any person, firm, business or governmental agency or department, except as such disclosure is	0	c
expressly permitted in this Agreement. Recipient will treat all of Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of	0	c
care as Recipient treats its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care. Recipient will disclose Discloser’s	0	c
Confidential Information only to those of Recipient’s employees, consultants, and contractors who have a “need to know” the	0	c
information to assist Recipient with respect to the Purpose and who are legally bound by terms and conditions substantially	0	c
similar to those terms and conditions applicable to Recipient under this Agreement. Neither party is obligated under this	0	c
Agreement to purchase from or provide to the other party any service or product. Recipient agrees not to copy or reverse	0	c
engineer, or attempt to derive the composition or underlying information, structure or ideas of any Confidential Information. No	0	c
licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement;	0	c
Recipient does not acquire any right in or to the Confidential Information except the limited right to use it for the Purpose.	0	s
3. Recipient’s obligations under Section 2 will not apply to any of Discloser’s Confidential Information that Recipient can	0	c
document: (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time the Confidential Information was communicated to	0	c
Recipient by Discloser through no fault of Recipient; (b) was rightfully in Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of	0	c
confidence at or subsequent to the time the Confidential Information was communicated to Recipient by the Discloser; (c) was	0	c
developed by employees or agents of Recipient independently of and without reference to any of Discloser’s Confidential	0	c
Information; or (d) was communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence. A	0	c
disclosure by Recipient of any of Discloser’s Confidential Information (a) in response to a valid order by a court or other	0	c
governmental body; (b) as otherwise required by law; or (c) necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement	0	c
will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient; provided, however, that Recipient provides prompt	0	c
prior written notice to the Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent the disclosure.	0	c
4. Neither party will communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party. ALL	0	s
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR	0	c
IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND NONINFRINGEMENT, ARE	0	c
HEREBY DISCLAIMED. Discloser will have no liability or responsibility for reasonably unknown errors or omissions in, or any	0	c
decisions made by Recipient in reliance on, any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.	0	s
5. Recipient will obtain any licenses or approvals the U.S. government or any of its agencies require prior to exporting, directly or	0	c
indirectly, any technical data acquired from Discloser pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing that data.	0	s
6. This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and will continue until the date one party receives written notice	0	c
of termination of this Agreement from the other party; provided, however, that a Recipient’s obligations under Section 2 will	0	c
survive termination of this Agreement and will continue with respect to the Discloser’s Confidential Information until the	0	c
obligations no longer apply pursuant to Section 3 above.	0	s
7. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement will be and will remain the property of the Discloser; all such	0	c
information in tangible form will be returned to Discloser promptly upon written request or upon the termination or expiration	0	c
of this Agreement, and will not thereafter be retained in any form by Recipient or its Affiliates or any of their employees. Except	0	c
upon mutual written agreement or as may be required by law, neither party will disclose to others the existence or terms of this	0	c
Agreement, the discussions that gave rise to this Agreement or the fact that there have been, or will be, discussions or	0	c
negotiations covered by this Agreement.	0	s
8. The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information is unique and valuable and a breach by Recipient of this	0	c
Agreement will cause irreparable and continuing damage to Discloser for which money damages are insufficient. In the event of	0	c
a breach or threatened breach of the obligations under this Agreement, Discloser will be entitled to: (1) seek specific performance	0	c
and injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond, and (ii) indemnification from any loss or harm,	0	c
including recovery of attorney’s fees, in connection with any breach or enforcement of Recipient’s obligations hereunder or the	0	c
unauthorized use or release of such Confidential Information. Any such relief will be in addition to and not in lieu of any	0	c
appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages. Recipient must notify Discloser in writing immediately upon the occurrence	0	c
of any such unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware and will assist Discloser in remedying the unauthorized use	0	c
or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information.	0	s
9. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered as follows, with notice deemed	0	c
given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery, when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier, upon written verification of	0	c
receipt; or (c) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt. Notice will be sent to the	0	c
addresses set forth above or to such other address as either party may provide in writing.	0	s
10. This Agreement (a) is the complete agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior	0	c
agreements whether oral or written with respect to disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or	0	c
modified except by in a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties; and (c) will be governed and construed in	0	c
accordance with the laws of Delaware without regard to conflict of laws provisions. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to	0	c
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New Castle County, Delaware as applicable, for any	0	c
matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of the	0	c
federal or state courts located in New Castle County, Delaware such personal jurisdiction will be non-exclusive. Additionally,	0	c
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement	0	c
may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder,	0	c
except to an Affiliate, without the prior written consent of the other party. No failure or delay in exercising or any partial exercise	0	c
of any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be	0	c
unenforceable, the remainder will be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to	0	c
the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties as	0	c
expressed herein.	-1	s
The parties agree and are signing this Agreement as of the Effective Date.	-1	s
