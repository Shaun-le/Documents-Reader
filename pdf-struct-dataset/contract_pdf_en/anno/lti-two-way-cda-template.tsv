NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT	0	x
This is a Non-Disclosure Agreement, effective __________________, between (company) (hereinafter	0	c
referred to as "_____"), with an address of                          , a              corporation       and	0	c
Lyophilization Technology, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "LTI"), a Pennsylvania corporation, with an	0	c
address of 30 Indian Drive, Ivyland, PA 18974.  It is recognized that it may be necessary or desirable to	0	c
exchange information between       and  LTI  for  the  purpose  of  a  potential  business  relationship  (the	0	c
“Purpose”).	0	s
It may be necessary for either Party to provide confidential and/or proprietary information to the other.	0	c
With respect to such information, the Parties agree as follows:	0	d
1)  “Proprietary  Information”  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  information  regarding  business	0	c
matters,  know-how,  data  (technical  or  non-technical),  product  samples  and  specifications,	0	c
customer information,  as well as performance, sales, financial, contractual and special marketing	0	c
information, ideas, technical data and concepts not previously published or otherwise disclosed to	0	c
the general public, not previously available without restriction to the receiving Party or others, and	0	c
which the disclosing Party desires to protect pursuant to this Non-Disclosure Agreement.	0	s
2)  Proprietary  Information  must  be:  (a)  in  writing;  (b)  clearly  identified  as  Proprietary  Information  at	0	c
the time of its disclosure by each page thereof being marked with an appropriate legend indicating	0	c
that  the  information  is  deemed  proprietary  by  the  disclosing  Party;  and  (c)  delivered  by  letter  of	0	c
transmittal  to  the  receiving  Party.  Where  the  Proprietary  Information  has  not  been  or  cannot  be	0	c
reduced  to  written  form  at  the  time  of  disclosure  and  such  disclosure  is  made  orally  or  visually,	0	c
complete written summaries of all proprietary aspects of any such oral or visual disclosures shall	0	c
have  been  delivered  to  the  receiving  Party  within  20  calendar  days  of  said  oral  or  visual	0	c
disclosures;  provided,  however,  that  Proprietary  Information  that  is  not  marked  or  reduced  to	0	c
writing is protected under this Non-Disclosure Agreement if the context and manner in which such	0	c
Proprietary  Information  is  disclosed  would  indicate  to  a  reasonable  person  familiar  with  the	0	c
pharmaceutical  industry  that  such  Proprietary  Information  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  be	0	c
treated as confidential. Neither Party shall identify information as proprietary which is not in good	0	c
faith believed to be confidential, privileged, a trade secret, or otherwise entitled to such markings or	0	c
proprietary claims.	0	s
3)  Each  Party  covenants  and  agrees  that  it  will,  during  the  term  of  this  Non-Disclosure  Agreement,	0	c
keep in confidence, and prevent the disclosure of Proprietary Information to any third party other	0	c
than  those  of  receiving  Party’s  (i)  employees,  agents,  representatives,  directors  or  officers	0	c
(collectively,  “Representatives”)  who  need  to  know  such  Proprietary  Information  for  the  Purpose.	0	c
Each  Party  shall  be  responsible  for  any  breach  of  this  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  by  itself  or  its	0	c
Representatives.  A receiving Party shall not be liable for disclosure of any Proprietary Information	0	c
if the same:	0	d
A.  Was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed, or	0	s
B.  Becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Non-Disclosure Agreement, or	0	s
C.  Is disclosed with the written approval of the other Party, or	0	s
D.  Was already in the receiving Party’s possession at the time it was disclosed, or	0	s

E.  Was independently developed by the receiving Party, or	0	s
F.  Is or was disclosed by the disclosing Party to a third Party without restriction, or	0	s
G.  Is  disclosed  to  the  receiving  Party  by  a  third  party  with  no  confidentiality  obligations  to  the	0	c
disclosing Party.	36	b
If receiving Party is required by applicable law, or by process issued in connection with a judicial or	0	c
administrative  proceeding,  to  disclose  any  of  disclosing  Party’s  Proprietary  Information,  receiving	0	c
Party  shall  immediately  notify  disclosing  Party  of  such  legal  requirement or  the  issuance  of  such	0	c
process so disclosing Party has the opportunity to seek a protective order.  If disclosing Party fails	0	c
to  obtain  a  protective  order,  receiving  Party  may  disclose  only  those  pieces  of  Proprietary	0	c
Information that it is legally required to disclose.	0	b
Any Proprietary Information provided by one Party to the other shall be used only in furtherance of	0	c
the Purpose.  Proprietary Information shall be, upon request at any time, destroyed or returned to	0	c
the  disclosing  Party,  provided  that  receiving  Party  may  retain  one  (1)  copy  of  such  Proprietary	0	c
Information  for  purposes  of  monitoring  compliance  with  its  obligations  under  this  Non-Disclosure	0	c
Agreement. If either Party loses or makes unauthorized disclosure of the other Party’s Proprietary	0	c
Information,  it  shall  notify  such  other  Party  immediately  and  take  all  steps  reasonable  and	0	c
necessary to retrieve the lost or improperly disclosed Proprietary Information.	0	s
4)  The  standard  of  care  for  protecting  Proprietary  Information  imposed  on  the  Party  receiving  such	0	c
information, will be that degree of care the receiving Party uses to prevent disclosure, publication	0	c
or  dissemination  of  its  own  proprietary  information,  but  not  less  than  a  reasonable  standard  of	0	c
care.	0	s
5)  In addition to all other rights and remedies, disclosing Party has the right to seek an injunction to	0	c
prevent  receiving  Party’s  actual  or  threatened  breach  of  this  Non-Disclosure  Agreement,  without	0	c
having to prove actual damages or post a bond.	0	s
6)  In  providing  any  information  hereunder,  each  disclosing  Party  makes  no  representations,  either	0	c
express  or  implied,  as  to  the  information’s  adequacy,  sufficiency,  or  freedom  from  defect  of  any	0	c
kind,  including  freedom  from  any  patent  infringement  that  may  result  from  the  use  of  such	0	c
information.	0	s
7)  Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of any other agreement executed in conjunction with	0	c
this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties with respect to Proprietary Information shall continue	0	c
to be governed by this Non-Disclosure Agreement.	0	s
8)  This  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  contains  the  entire  agreement  relative  to  the  protection  of	0	c
information  to  be  exchanged  hereunder,  and  supersedes  all  prior  or  contemporaneous  oral  or	0	c
written  understandings  and  agreements  regarding  this  issue.  A  Party’s  failure  to  exercise  a  right	0	c
under  this  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  or  failure  to  insist  upon  compliance  with  any  term  of  this	0	c
Non-Disclosure  Agreement  shall  not  be  a  waiver  of  that  right  or  term.    If  any  provision  of  this	0	c
Non-Disclosure  Agreement  is  invalid  or  unenforceable,  that  provision  shall  be  severed  from  this	0	c
Non-Disclosure  Agreement  and  the  other  provisions  shall  remain  in  force.    This  Non-Disclosure	0	c
Agreement  shall  not  be  modified  or  amended,  except  in  a  written  instrument  executed  by  the	0	c
Parties.	0	s

9)  Nothing contained in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall, by express grant, implication, estoppel	0	c
or  otherwise,  create  in  either  Party  any  right,  title,  interest,  or  license  in  or  to  the  Proprietary	0	c
Information, inventions, patents, technical data, computer software, or software documentation of	0	c
the other Party.	0	s
10)  Nothing  contained  in  this  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  shall  grant to  either  Party  the right to make	0	c
commitments of any kind for or on behalf of any other Party without the prior written consent of that	0	c
other Party.	0	s
11)  This  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  may  not  be  assigned  by  either  Party  without  the  prior  written	0	c
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.	0	s
12)  Receiving Party’s confidentiality and non-use obligations under this Non-Disclosure Agreement will	0	c
be in effect for a period of five (5) years, starting on the effective date.  The effective date of this	0	c
Non-Disclosure  Agreement  shall  be  the  date  stipulated  at  the  beginning  of  this  Non-Disclosure	0	c
Agreement.	0	s
13)  This Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of	0	c
the State of Delaware.  The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Delaware	0	c
to resolve any disputes arising under or relating to this Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The prevailing	0	c
Party  in  a  dispute  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  its  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  from  the	0	c
other Party.	0	s
14)  This Non-Disclosure Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which is an	0	c
original,  and  all  of  which  constitute  only  one  agreement.    Counterparts  of  this  Non-Disclosure	0	c
Agreement delivered electronically (in “.pdf” format) or by facsimile shall have the same legal force	0	c
