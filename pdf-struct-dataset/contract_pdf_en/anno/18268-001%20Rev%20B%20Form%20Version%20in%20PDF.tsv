Confidential Information to any party who do not meet the preceding requirements.	0	c
Receiver shall use the same degree of care to protect and safeguard the	0	c
confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect and safeguard the	0	c
confidentiality of its own proprietary information, and Receiver represents, warrants	0	c
and covenants to VIDAR that such degree of care is reasonably designed to protect	0	c
the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.	0	s

(a) was generally available at the time it was disclosed other than as a result of a	0	c
disclosure made by Receiver;	0	s
(b) was known to the Receiver at the time it received such information, as evidenced	0	c
by contemporaneous documentation in Receiver’s files;	0	s

(e) is disclosed to a third party by VIDAR without restrictions against non-disclosure	0	c
similar to those contained in this Agreement;	0	s
(f)  is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court; administrative	0	c

to keep the Confidential Information from becoming part of public records; or	0	s

use of any Confidential Information;	48	c
provided for each that: (i) Receiver promptly notifies VIDAR of such action; and (ii) in	0	c

5.  Intellectual Property	0	d
(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights,	0	c

relating to any Confidential Information in or for any intellectual property,	0	c
invention, discovery or improvement or derivative made, conceived or acquired	0	c
prior or subsequent to the Effective Date.  Except for the limited right to use the	0	c
Confidential Information as set forth above, all intellectual property, patent,	0	c
copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other rights and interests in the	0	c
Confidential Information and the products, inventions, ideas, works, creation,	0	c
symbols, data, reports, opinions and all other concepts and materials developed,	0	c
invented, reduced to practice, authored or created by Receiver (including	0	c
portions and derivatives thereof) in any medium arising from or relating to this	0	c
Agreement (“Intellectual Property”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of	0	c
VIDAR.	0	s
(b) All Intellectual Property that are original works of authorship shall be considered	0	c
works made for hire (as that phrase is used in Section 101 of the United States	0	c

found not to be a work made for hire and/or is owned by Receiver or any third	0	c

(c) Receiver shall promptly disclose all Intellectual Property to VIDAR and shall	0	c
make and maintain adequate and current written records of all Intellectual	0	c
Property.  Receiver agrees to take all actions, execute all instruments and fully	0	c
cooperate with VIDAR, its successors, assigns or nominees in which, in the	0	c
opinion of VIDAR, are expedient or necessary at any time to file, prosecute,	0	c
register, evidence, secure, maintain or litigate all such VIDAR rights and interests	0	c
in the Intellectual Property throughout the world, including all commercial, legal or	0	c
administrative proceedings involving the same.  All expenses of applying for and	0	c
obtaining such rights and interests shall be borne by VIDAR.  VIDAR shall	0	c
reimburse Receiver for pre-approved expenses paid in connection with such	0	c
cooperation.	71	s
6.  Return of Confidential Information.  Upon the request of VIDAR or the termination or	0	c
expiration of this Confidential Agreement, Receiver shall promptly return to VIDAR	0	c
all copies of the Confidential Information and obtained by Receiver.	0	s
7.  Disclaimer.  Receiver acknowledges that the Confidential Information may relate to	0	c
processes or products that are developmental and may or may not have been	0	c
reduced to practical application in prototype form. Accordingly, Receiver	0	c
understands that neither VIDAR has made or makes any representation or warranty	0	c
as to the accuracy, completeness or value of the Confidential Information.	0	c
RECEIVER AGREES THAT NEITHER VIDAR NOR ANY OF ITS	0	c
REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO RECEIVER OR ANY OF	0	c
ITS REPRESENTATIVES RESULTING FROM RECEIVER’S ACCESS TO OR USE	0	c
OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.	0	s
8.  Injunction.  Receiver acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Confidential Information	0	c
is proprietary to and valuable information of VIDAR; (ii) VIDAR derives economic	0	c
value from the Confidential Information not being generally known to other persons	0	c
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; (iii) any disclosure or	0	c
unauthorized use of the Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and	0	c
loss to VIDAR; and (iv) if this Agreement is breached, VIDAR can not be made	0	c
whole by monetary damages.  Accordingly, VIDAR, in addition to any other remedy	0	c
to which it may be entitled by law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction to	0	c
prevent further breaches of this Agreement and to an order compelling specific	0	c
performance of this Agreement.  Receiver shall reimburse VIDAR for all costs and	0	c
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by VIDAR in enforcing the obligations	0	c
of Receiver.	0	s
9.  General.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,	0	c
the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and all actions involving this Agreement	0	c
shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of	0	c
Virginia, to which the parties consent to jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall be	0	c
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives,	0	c
successors and assigns.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this	0	c
Agreement, nor any rights granted hereunder may be assigned, transferred,	0	c
conveyed or encumbered, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, by Receiver	0	c
without the prior written consent of VIDAR (which may be granted or withheld in	0	c
VIDAR’s sole and absolute judgment), and any attempt to do so will be deemed null	0	c
and void.  This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and continues in	0	c
effect thereafter for so long as any Confidential Information continues to exist.	0	c
VIDAR may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason.  Any provision of	0	c
this Agreement which is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any	0	c
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such	0	c
prohibition, unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining	0	c

provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision	0	c
in any other jurisdiction.  This Agreement contains the entire understanding and	0	c
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein,	0	c
supersedes all prior oral or written understandings and agreements relating thereto,	0	c
except as expressly otherwise provided, and may not be altered, modified or waived	0	c
in whole or in part, except in writing, signed by duly authorized representatives of the	0	c
parties hereto.  The failure of either party to insist upon the performance of any of	0	c
the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Agreement shall not be	0	c
considered a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance therewith; nor shall a	0	c
waiver by either party of any breach or any term, covenant, condition, agreement or	0	c
provision, operate as a waiver of any other term, covenant condition, agreement or	0	c
provision.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by	0	c
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed	0	c
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall	0	c
constitute one and the same instrument.	-1	s
