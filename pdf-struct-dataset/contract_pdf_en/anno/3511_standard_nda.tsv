between The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., (NASDAQ OMX) a Delaware Corporation whose principal	0	c
offices are located at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, 10006 Corporation (NASDAQ OMX and	0	c
its affiliates are collectively referred to as the Corporations), and ________________________	0	c
(Recipient), whose principal offices are located at ___________________________________________.	0	s
In consideration of NASDAQ OMXâ€™s past, present, and/or future provision of access to certain	0	c
confidential  information  by  Recipient  in  order  to  permit  Recipient  to  evaluate,  plan  for,  implement,	0	c
complete obligations under an Agreement for Professional Services, or participate in projects, contracts,	0	c
or  other  arrangements  between  the  parties  (Project)  and  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the	0	c
sufficiency of which is acknowledged, it is agreed as follows:	0	d
1.      Recipient may be provided with access to selected information (oral, written, or electronic) of the	0	c
other  (including  of  any  of  the  Corporations)  which  helps  meet  a  regulatory  purpose  or  business  need,	0	c
including,  but  not  limited  to,  that  information  which  relates  or  refers  to:  business  planning;  internal	0	c
controls;  computer,  data  processing,  or  communications  architectures  or  systems;  electronic  data	0	c
processing architectures, applications, programs, routines, or subroutines; business affairs and methods of	0	c
operation or proposed methods of operations, techniques or systems of a party (including of any of the	0	c
Corporations)  or  any  customer  of  a  party  (including  of  any  of  the  Corporations);  financial  or  other	0	c
non-public information.  Some of the information in each of these categories is confidential in nature or	0	c
constitutes a trade secret.  This information received from a party (including of any of the Corporations),	0	c
either orally or in writing, during the course of the Project shall be deemed to be confidential information	0	c
(Confidential Information) for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement.  Notes, documents, summaries	0	c
or reports which are prepared from Confidential Information to the extent such specifically refer or relate	0	c
to Confidential Information are themselves Confidential Information.	0	s
2.      Recipient  acknowledges  the  sensitive  and  secret  nature  of  the  Confidential  Information  it  will	0	c
have  access  to  during  the  term  of  this  Agreement  and  agrees  that  it  will  treat  such  Confidential	0	c
Information  as  strictly  confidential  and  shall  exercise  the  same  degree  of  care  in  the  protection  of  the	0	c
Confidential Information as the Recipient exercises with respect to its own proprietary property and trade	0	c
secrets,  but  in  no  event  shall  it  be  less  than  a  reasonable  degree  of  care  given  the  nature  of  the	0	c
Confidential Information.	0	s
3.      Recipient  shall  not  disclose  Confidential  Information  to  any  person  or  entity,  except  its	0	c
employees  or  partners  involved  in  the  Project,  or  to  use  the  Confidential  Information  for  any  purpose	0	c
other than fulfilling its obligations under the Project.  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that breach of	0	c
this  Confidentiality  Agreement  by  Recipient  and/or  anyone  employed  by  or  otherwise  associated  with	0	c
Recipient may also constitute a violation of the Insider Trading Act and/or other securities and other laws.	0	c
Access to or disclosure of Confidential Information by Recipient shall be limited to those employees or	0	c
partners  covered  by  a  then  effective  legal  obligation  or  agreement  with  Recipient  that  prohibits  the	0	c
disclosure or unauthorized use of confidential information deemed confidential by Recipient (Authorized	0	c
Employees).  The existence of such an agreement with an employee or partner of the Recipient shall not	0	c
operate to relieve the Recipient from liability for acts of such employee or partner that result in a breach	0	c
of this Confidentiality Agreement.	0	s
04/08 version	0	e
4.      Recipient shall not make copies of the Confidential Information except for those copies required	0	c
for use by Authorized Employees in the performance of the Agreement.  Each copy, including its storage	0	c
media,  shall  be  marked  Confidential,  and  also  include  all  copyright,  trademark  and  other  proprietary	0	c
notices which appear on the original.  The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information, including	0	c
any  copies  thereof,  shall  be  returned  to  NASDAQ  OMX  or  destroyed  within  ten  (10)  days  of  the	0	c
expiration or other termination of the Project.	0	s
5.      Notes and other documents referencing or relating to Confidential Information may be made and	0	c
kept by the Recipient, but shall continue to be governed by this Confidentiality Agreement until they are	0	c
destroyed.	0	s
6.      All  intellectual  property  rights  associated  with  the  Confidential  Information,  including  without	0	c
limitation,  patent,  trademark,  copyright,  trade  secret  rights,  and  moral  rights  shall  remain  in  NASDAQ	0	c
OMX.	0	s
7.      The obligation of non-disclosure shall not extend to: (1) information which is then already in the	0	c
possession  of  the  Recipient  and  not  under  a  duty  of  non-disclosure;  (2)  information  which  is  generally	0	c
known or revealed to the public other than by breach of this Agreement; (3) information which is revealed	0	c
to the Recipient by a third party--unless such party is under a duty of non-disclosure; or (4) information	0	c
which the Recipient develops independently of the disclosure as indicated by files existing at the time of	0	c
initial disclosure.	0	s
8.      In  the  event  Recipient  receives  a  subpoena  or  other  validly  issued  administrative  or  judicial	0	c
process requesting Confidential Information, Recipient shall provide prompt actual notice to the General	0	c
Counsel of NASDAQ OMX of such receipt, providing the Corporations with a reasonable opportunity to	0	c
intervene in the proceeding before the time that Recipient is required to comply with such subpoena or	0	c
other process.  In the event that NASDAQ OMX instructs Recipient not to comply with any portion or all	0	c
of the process, Recipient shall comply with such instructions and NASDAQ OMX shall indemnify and	0	c
hold  harmless  the  Recipient  from  any  damages  to  the  extent  that  Recipient's  damages  result  from  its	0	c
compliance with NASDAQ OMX's instructions.	0	s
9.      Recipient  acknowledges  that  NASDAQ  OMX,  because  of  the  nature  of  the  Confidential	0	c
Information,  would  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  event  of  a  material  breach  of  the  provisions  of  this	0	c
Confidentiality  Agreement  in  that  monetary  damages  would  be  inadequate  to  compensate  NASDAQ	0	c
OMX for such a breach, and that in the event of any material breach or threatened material breach by the	0	c
Recipient  of  any  such  provisions,  NASDAQ  OMX  shall  be  entitled,  in  addition  to  such  other  legal  or	0	c
equitable  remedies  which  might  be  available,  to  injunctive  relief  in  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction	0	c
against  the  threatened  material  breach  or  continuation  of  any  such  material  breach  without  showing  or	0	c
proving  any  actual  damages  sustained  by  NASDAQ  OMX.    If  NASDAQ  OMX  prevails  in  any  action	0	c
brought  to  enjoin  a  material  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  this  Confidentiality  Agreement,  it  shall  be	0	c
entitled  to  reasonable  attorney's  fees  and  costs  in  connection  with  such  legal  proceeding.    This	0	c
Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its	0	c
principles of conflicts of laws.	0	s
10.    The representations and obligations of the Recipient relative to the Confidential Information shall	0	c
survive the termination of this Confidentiality Agreement for a period up to three (3) years from the date	0	c
of the completion or other termination of the Project.	0	s

11.    This  Confidentiality  Agreement  contains  the  full  and  complete  understanding  of  Recipient  and	0	c
NASDAQ  OMX  with  respect  to  the  subject  matter  and  supersedes  all  prior  representations  and	0	c
understandings whether they be oral or written.	0	s
12.    Recipient and NASDAQ OMX understand and agree that in the event any part, term or provision	0	c
of  this  Confidentiality  Agreement  is  held  to  be  invalid  or  legally  unenforceable,  the  validity  of  the	0	c
remaining  parts,  terms  or  provisions  shall  not  be  affected,  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties	0	c
shall  be  construed  and  enforced  as  if  the  Confidentiality  Agreement  did  not  contain  the  particular  part,	0	c
term, or provision held to be invalid.	0	s
13.    The persons executing this Confidentiality Agreement warrant that they have the authority to bind	0	c
NASDAQ  OMX  and  the  Recipient  to  the  terms  and  conditions  embodied  in  this  Confidentiality	0	c
