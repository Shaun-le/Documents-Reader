(including  financial,  legal  and  tax  advisors  and  auditors)  (“Representatives”),  by  the  Sellers,  their	0	c
advisors or their representatives;	0	s
b)  all  such  analyses,  compilations,  forecasts,  notes,  memoranda  and  other  documents  as  the  Sellers  or	0	c

result of a breach of this Agreement by the Disclosee or their Representatives;	0	s
b) information which was lawfully in the Disclosee’s possession or in the possession of one or more of their	0	c
Representatives prior to disclosure under this Agreement, in each case on a non-confidential basis, which,	0	c

The Disclosee acknowledges that they may not approach the representatives of the Sellers and cannot contact	0	c
anybody else other than the contact persons from the Advisors.	0	s
The  Disclosee  further  undertakes  and  acknowledges,  that  neither  the  representatives  of  the  Sellers  nor  their	0	c
Advisors  give  any  warranty  or  make  any  representation  as  to  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of  any  of  the	0	c
Confidential Information or as to the reasonableness of any assumptions on which the information is based. The	0	c
Disclosee agrees that the Sellers or Advisors shall not have any liability to the Disclosee or to any of their directors,	0	c
employees, advisors or agents resulting from the use of Confidential Information.	0	s

This Agreement shall in no way constitute a commitment by any person to supply any Confidential Information	0	c
or enter into any contract in connection with the Sellers. The obligations of the Disclosee under this Agreement	0	c
shall expire the earlier of (a) three years after the date of this Agreement, or (b) the date the Sale between the	0	c
Candidate and the Sellers is completed. The obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure under this Agreement	0	c
shall become effective as of the date of signing.	0	s
In the event that the Disclosee or any of its Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the	0	c
Confidential  Information  to  a  regulatory  authority  or  to  any  other  entity  or  third  party,  the  Disclosee  shall	0	c
immediately  notify  the  Sellers  before  disclosing  such  Confidential  Information,  so  that  the  Sellers  may  seek  a	0	c
protective order or other appropriate remedy, without prejudice to the Disclosee’s remedies under this Agreement.	0	s
It is further understood and agreed that, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which either party	0	c
may have, any breach of these undertakings could cause the Sellers and/or its shareholders irreparable injury. In	0	c
the event of an actual or threatened breach by the Disclosee and/or its Representatives of any provisions of this	0	c
Agreement,  the  Sellers  shall  be  entitled  (i)  to  seek  injunctive  relief  in  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction	0	c
restraining  the  Disclosee  and/or  its  Representatives  from  breaching  the  terms  hereof  or  from  disclosing  any	0	c
Confidential Information to any person and (ii) specific performance and other equitable relief.	0	s
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Belgian law and the Parties irrevocably	0	c
agree  to  submit  themselves  to  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  of  Brussels.  In  accordance  with  the	0	c
procedure  defined  in  the  candidacy  file,  we  would  be  grateful  if  you  could  confirm  your  understanding  and	0	c
acceptance of the foregoing by returning to us a signed copy of the present document	-1	s
