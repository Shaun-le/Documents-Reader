___________________________________________________, (together with its affiliates, including,	0	c
but not limited to its professional third party service providers, its successors and assigns,	0	c
hereinafter collectively referred to as “Recipient”).	0	s
WHEREAS, Discloser is in the business of owning and operating a cinema/eatery/micro-	0	c
brewery concept called Flix Brewhouse, which is currently being expanded nationwide (the	0	c

WHEREAS, Recipient is generally familiar with the movie exhibition industry, and Discloser	0	c

matters with each other relating to Discloser’s business, including, but not limited to strategy,	0	c
planning, debt and/or equity financing solutions and ideas (collectively defined hereinafter as	0	c
“Business Opportunities”).	0	s
WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the parties hereto for Discloser to provide Recipient with	0	c
certain valuable information that is considered highly confidential and proprietary, in order to most	0	c
effectively further the discussions between Discloser and Recipient.	0	s
WHEREAS, Recipient acknowledges and understands that it would be highly injurious to	0	c
Discloser should Discloser’s valuable and confidential information or identity be disclosed generally,	0	c
or find its way into the public domain through the Recipient.	0	s
NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed that, except where modified in writing, the following terms	0	c
and conditions shall be applicable to all communications between Discloser and Recipient:	0	d
1.      Confidential Information.  It is contemplated that Confidential Information (as defined	0	c
herein) will be transferred from Discloser to Recipient in connection herewith and that Confidential	0	c
Information shall be used by Recipient only for purposes of evaluating whether it might have interest	0	c
in discussing Business Opportunities with Recipient.	0	d
a.      For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean any	0	c
proprietary information belonging to Discloser relating to:  (i) Discloser’s proprietary	0	c
technology, systems, service offering and products, including without limitation, plans and	0	c
specifications, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product plans, ideas or	0	c

concepts, services, software, inventions, intellectual property rights, techniques, processes,	0	c
developments, algorithms, formulas, technology, designs, schematics, drawings, engineering,	0	c
and hardware configuration information (collectively referred to as “Technical Information”);	0	c
and (ii) proprietary information relating to the financial information of any of the principals	0	c
of Discloser, Discloser’s corporate financial information or its operations and business or	0	c
financial plans or strategies, including but not limited to its identity, customers, customer	0	c
lists, markets, real estate development plans, financial statements and projections, products,	0	c
product pricing and marketing, financial or other strategic business plans or information	0	c
(collectively referred to as “Business Information”), disclosed to Recipient by Discloser, either	0	c
directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of samples, equipment or	0	c
facilities.  For purposes of this agreement, Confidential Information shall be assumed to be of	0	c
a confidential and/or proprietary nature by Recipient, as it is reasonable to assume and	0	c
expect that said Business Information is highly relevant to the success of its Discloser’s	0	c
business and is not known to the public.	0	s
b.     The restrictions set forth herein shall not apply with respect to information	0	c
designated by Discloser as Confidential which: (i) is known by Recipient at the time of receipt	0	c
as evidenced by Recipient’s records; (ii) is or becomes a part of the public domain without	0	c
breach of the Agreement by Recipient; (iii) is obtained by Recipient from a third party under	0	c
conditions permitting its disclosure to others; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient;	0	c
or (v) is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to judicial action or Government regulations	0	c
provided Recipient notifies Discloser prior to such disclosure and cooperates with Discloser in	0	c
the event Discloser elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.	27	s
2.      Identification of Confidential Information.  For the purpose of the Agreement, written	0	c
Business or Technical Information (including that which is delivered electronically) that is considered	0	c
to be Confidential Information by Discloser, shall be so marked by Discloser.  Information that is	0	c
furnished orally shall be considered Confidential Information if Discloser so indicates.  Additionally,	0	c
information furnished by Discloser shall be deemed Confidential Information if it is obvious from its	0	c
content, in the context under which it is furnished.	0	s
3.      Subsequent Notice of Confidentiality.  Discloser may give notice in writing that written or	0	c
verbal information that has been previously furnished, but not declared confidential, is in fact	0	c
confidential.  This information is to be treated as Confidential Information by Recipient from the	0	c
time of receipt of said notice. That being said, Recipient shall make every reasonable effort to mark	0	c
all written copies of such information under its control as “Confidential” or “Proprietary” and to	0	c
make every reasonable effort to inform Discloser of any disclosures by Recipient to third parties of	0	c
such information that may have occurred between the time of receipt of the information and receipt	0	c
by Recipient of notice that such information is confidential.  Recipient has no responsibility to	0	c
attempt to control the use of such information by such a third party.	0	c

4.      Term, Non-Disclosure and Use.  For a period of two (2) years from the date of receipt, all	0	c
Confidential Information shall be maintained in confidence by Recipient, shall not be disclosed,	0	c
published, communicated, divulged or revealed in any manner, to any other person, firm,	0	c
corporation or other third party entity, including employees of Recipient who do not have a need to	0	c
know, or who should not know any such details pertaining to Confidential Information in the course	0	c
of their employment, except as may  otherwise provided in this Agreement.  Recipient further	0	c
affirmatively agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from Discloser except for the	0	c
express purposes set forth herein.	0	s
5.      No License Granted.  Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not be	0	c
construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights or licenses to Recipient,	0	c
by the furnishing of Confidential Information by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement.	0	c
6.      Ownership and Return of Confidential Information.  All tangible information, including	0	c
drawings, specifications and other information furnished hereunder shall remain the property of	0	c
Discloser.  Upon request, or if either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking with	0	c
the other, Recipient shall promptly return all tangible information, including any and all copies or	0	c
partial copies thereof and thereupon confirm destruction of all information held electronically.	0	s
7.      No Warranty.  No warranty or representation is made by Discloser that any information	0	c
transmitted by it hereunder is true and correct, patentable or copyrightable, or that any such	0	c
information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.	0	c
8.      Equitable Relief.  Discloser and Recipient agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to	0	c
measure and calculate Discloser’s damages from any breach of the covenants set forth herein,	0	c
especially with regard any breach associated with Confidential Information that was to be	0	c
maintained behind the Information Barrier.  Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that in the event of a	0	c
breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, Discloser will have available, in addition	0	c
to any other right or remedy available, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent	0	c
jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and to specific performance of any such	0	c
provision of this Agreement.  Recipient further agrees that no bond or other security shall be	0	c
required in obtaining such equitable relief and that Recipient hereby consents to the issuance of	0	c
such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. If any action or proceeding is brought to	0	c
enforce this Agreement because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default, or	0	c
misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, should it prevail,	0	c
Discloser shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such	0	c
action or proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.	0	s
9.      Effective Date.  This Agreement shall become effective as of date hereof and shall terminate	0	c
upon the express written termination by either one of the parties hereto.  Termination of the	0	c
