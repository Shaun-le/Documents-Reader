Supplier  as  an  approved  supplier  for  Supplies,  any  supply  of  such  Supplies  shall  be  under	0	c
Company’s  standard  General  Terms  and  Conditions  of  Purchase  without  the  need  for  further	0	c

respecting  the  subject  matter  hereof  and  supersedes  all  prior  agreements  between  the  parties	0	c
relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof,  whether  written  or  oral.    It  is  effective  on  execution  by	0	c
Supplier.    No  waiver  or  modification  of  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  valid  unless  in	0	c
writing and duly executed by Supplier and Company.  This Agreement shall be cumulative with	0	c
all  other  rights  of  Company  under  any  existing  or  future  agreements  between  Company  and	0	c

D.     This  Agreement  shall  be  construed  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of	0	c
Michigan, notwithstanding principles of Michigan or any other state, provided Company may in	0	c
any  enforcement  action  elect  to  have  the  law  of  the  forum  jurisdiction  to  apply.    The  parties	0	c
irrevocably  consent  to  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which	0	c
Company  has  an  office  to  resolve  all  issues  related  to  or  arising from  this  Agreement  and  any	0	c
business  relationship  arising  from  or  related  to  this  Agreement.    If  the  law  applicable  to  any	0	c
enforcement proceeding limits the class of information and materials protectible by contract to	0	c
trade secrets or other class of information, the term “Confidential Information” shall be limited	0	c
to  those  classes  of  information  and  materials.    If  the  law  applicable  to  any  enforcement	0	c
proceeding  requires  a  temporal  limitation,  the  period  after  termination  for  which  Supplier  is	0	c
restricted  in  use  or  disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  which  is  not  a  trade  secret  shall  be	0	c
limited to any specific maximum permitted by law or five years from the date of termination.  If	0	c
the  law  applicable  to  any  enforcement  proceeding  requires  a  geographic  limitation,  the  area  in	0	c
which Supplier is restricted in its use or disclosure of Confidential Information shall be limited to	0	c
3	0	e
only those states and countries in which Company or a supplier or customer of Company shall	0	c
have  an  office  or  other  facility  during  the  restricted  period.    If  the  law  applicable  to  any	0	c
enforcement proceeding requires a limitation on the scope of any restriction, such restriction in	0	c
the Agreement is limited to those activities which Supplier has performed for Company and to	0	c
those customers of Company with which Supplier has had some contact during the engagement	0	c
with Company.	0	s
E.     The  interests  of  Company  in  the  Confidential  Information  cannot  be	0	c
adequately  protected  by  a  remedy  at  law.    This  Agreement  may  be  enforced  by  preliminary	0	c
injunction as well as other available equitable and legal remedies.	0	s
F.     This  Agreement  is  not  assignable  by  Supplier.    This  Agreement  binds	0	c
Supplier  and  its  affiliated  companies  upon  execution  by  Supplier  whether  or  not  executed  by	0	c
Company.	0	s
