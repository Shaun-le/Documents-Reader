WHEREAS, the Company believes that stockholder list contains confidential information;	0	s
IT IS HEREBY AGREED, by and between the Parties, this  30th day of April 2015, as follows:	0	d
1.  Stockholder agrees that the Confidential Material is being produced to them only for	0	c

produced by the Company or anything derived from Confidential Material or derived	0	c
from any other information produced by the Company for any other purpose.	0	s

end; provided that in no event shall stockholder, directly or indirectly, publically	0	c
disclose, publish or communicate names, addresses, holdings of any other stockholder.	0	s
3.  If the Stockholder is required (by interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigatory demand,	0	c
or any similar process relating to any legal proceeding, investigation, hearing, or	0	c
otherwise) to disclose in any manner any Confidential Material, the Stockholder will	0	c
provide the Company with prompt notice (i.e., within 2 business days of receipt of such	0	c
interrogatory, subpoena, demand, or any similar process), so that the Company may	0	c
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this	0	c
Agreement in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if	0	c
the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the	0	c
Stockholder may furnish only such Confidential Material as they are advised is legally	0	c
required and must exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential	0	c
treatment will be accorded to any Confidential Material.	0	s
4.  Each Party who receives Confidential Material pursuant to this Agreement agrees to	0	c
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in any action to	0	c

including any action to determine any dispute as to the confidentiality of any	0	c
information or document produced by the Company.  Each Party hereby expressly	0	c
waives any and all objections such Party may have to personal jurisdiction or to venue,	0	c
including without limitation the inconvenience of such forum, in the Court of Chancery.	0	s
5.  Each Party agrees that the Company does not have an adequate remedy at law in the	0	c
event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder.  The Parties further agree that,	0	c
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder, the Company will suffer	0	c
irreparable harm and will be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive relief to	0	c
enforce the terms of this Agreement.  Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the	0	c

other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity.	0	s
6.  This Agreement may not be amended, changed, waived, discharged, or terminated	0	c
(except as explicitly provided herein), in whole or in part, except by an instrument in	0	c
writing that refers specifically to this Agreement and that is signed by the Party against	0	c
whom enforcement of such amendment, change, waiver, discharge, or termination is	0	c
sought.  The waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement will not be deemed or	0	c
construed as a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement, whether prior, subsequent,	0	c
or contemporaneous.  No failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege	0	c
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.	0	s
7.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their	0	c
respective agents, executors, heirs, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns.	0	s
