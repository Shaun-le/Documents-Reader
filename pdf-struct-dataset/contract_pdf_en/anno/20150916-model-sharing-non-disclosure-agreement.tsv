Information  to  a  third  party  without  the  prior  written  approval  of  the  Disclosing  Party.    Each	0	c

shall defend against disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to any Third Party Request	0	c

writing is legally required to be furnished, and to exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance	0	c

7.     Permitted  Limited  Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information.    Notwithstanding	0	c
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party may disclose Confidential Information to the	0	c
extent but only to the extent: (a) approved by the Disclosing Party in writing; or (b) required by	0	c
Law or an Authority, but only if: (i) the Party attempts to notify the Disclosing Party as  far in	0	c
advance  as  practicable  prior  to  making  disclosure  of  its  intent  to  disclose  Confidential	0	c
Information and of the content and mode of communication of the disclosure; and (ii) the Party	0	c
cooperates  with  the  Disclosing  Party's  efforts  to  obtain  a  protective  order  protecting  the	0	c
Confidential  Information  from  disclosure.    In  addition,  if  disclosure  is  required  by  Law  or	0	c
Authority, the Party to the extent practicable (and permitted by law), will (1) promptly notify the	0	c
Disclosing  Party  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  requirement,  (2)  consult  with  the	0	c
Disclosing Party on available options to request confidential treatment and/or the advisability of	0	c
taking legally available steps to resist or narrow the request or requirement for disclosure, and (3)	0	c
disclose  such  Confidential  Information  only  after  using  all  reasonable  efforts  to  comply  with	0	c
subsections  (1)  and  (2)  above  and  after  cooperating  with  the  Disclosing  Party’s  reasonable	0	c
efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be	0	c
accorded  to  any  portion  of  the  Confidential  Information  designated  for  such  treatment  by  the	0	c
Disclosing Party.  The Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is	0	c
responsive  to  the  request  or  requirement  for  disclosure,  and  will  request  that  confidential	0	c
treatment  be  accorded  to  the  Confidential  Information  by  the  person(s)  to  whom  the  Party  is	0	c
required by Law or Authority to disclose the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything	0	c
stated in this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall retain the burden of prosecuting any action	0	c
and/or seeking injunctive relief to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information. Disclosure	0	c
of Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not constitute a	0	c
waiver  of  the  protections  under  this  Agreement  or  the  confidentiality  of  such  Confidential	0	c
Information  and  such  Confidential  Information  shall  continue  to  be  treated  as  confidential  in	0	c
accordance with this Agreement.	0	s
8.     Ownership  and  Use  of  Confidential  Information.    All  Confidential  Information	0	c
delivered  by  a  Disclosing  Party  to  a  Party  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  be  and  remain  the	0	c
property of the Disclosing Party, and such Confidential Information shall be promptly returned to	0	c
the  Disclosing  Party  upon  request.    That  portion  of  the  Confidential  Information  that  may  be	0	c
found  in  analyses,  compilations,  studies  or  other  documents  prepared  by  or  for  a  Party  and  all	0	c
Confidential  Information  that  is  oral  will  be  kept  by  a  Party  subject  to  the  terms  of  this	0	c
Agreement  or  destroyed.    Neither  the  Party  nor  its  Reviewing  Representatives  shall  use  the	0	c
Confidential  Information  for  any  purpose  whatsoever  except  for  the  purpose  of  executing  the	0	c
Reviewing Party’s Transmission Functions.  Once the Party no longer requires the use of such	0	c
information  for  the  purpose  of  performing  its  Transmission  Functions,  the  Confidential	0	c
Information shall be returned or destroyed in accordance with this Agreement.	0	s
9.     Identification  of  Confidential  Information.    Confidential  Information  that  is  in	0	c
writing or other tangible form (including electronic form) shall be subject to this Agreement only	0	c
if  it  is  clearly  marked  as  "Confidential"  when  disclosed  by  the  Disclosing  Party  to  a  Party.	0	c
Confidential  Information  that  is  provided  orally  shall  be  subject  to  this  Agreement  only  if  its	0	c
confidential  nature  is  announced  at  the  time  of  disclosure  and  an  outline  of  the  scope  of  the	0	c
information  provided  is  reduced  to  writing,  with  a  copy  provided  to  the  Party  within  ten  (10)	0	c
calendar  days  of  oral  disclosure  of  the  information.    Inadvertent  failure  to  mark  Confidential	0	c
Information  as  “Confidential”  at  the  time  it  is  disclosed  shall  not  be  deemed  a  waiver  by  the	0	c
Disclosing  Party  of  the  protections  of  this  Agreement  provided  that  such  Confidential	0	c
Information  is  identified  and  marked  "Confidential"  promptly  upon  the  discovery  of  its	0	c
inadvertent  disclosure.    Confidential  Information  excludes  any  information  that:  (i)  the	0	c
Disclosing Party has not specifically notified the Party is confidential; (ii) becomes available to	0	c
the Party or the Reviewing Representative on a non-confidential basis from a source other than:	0	c

Information.	0	s
10.    Term  of  Agreement.    This  Agreement  shall  remain  in  effect  unless  and  until	0	c
terminated by the Parties.  The obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall continue and	0	c
survive  the  Transmission  Functions  for  which  the  Confidential  Information  was  disclosed  and	0	c
shall  remain  binding  under  this  Agreement  unless  disclosure  is  permitted  under  Section  8  or	0	c
required by Law or Authority.  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the term of protection	0	c
of Confidential Information otherwise protected by Law or Authority.	0	s
11.    Disclaimer  of  Warranties.    Each  Party  hereby  disclaims  and  does  not  make  any	0	c
express  or  implied  representation  or  warranty  concerning  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of	0	c
Confidential Information and no Disclosing Party shall have liability to the Party for the Party’s	0	c
use of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.  In addition, nothing in this Agreement	0	c
requires the disclosure of Confidential Information or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing	0	c
Party.  In addition, nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of Confidential Information	0	c
or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing Party to determine the extent of the Confidential	0	c
Information  disclosed.   Disclosure of Confidential  Information  of  any nature shall not  obligate	0	c
the Disclosing Party to disclose any further Confidential Information.	0	s
12.    No License.  No license to the Party, under any trademark, patent copyright, mask	0	c
work protection right or any other intellectual property right, is either granted or implied by the	0	c
conveying  of  Confidential  Information  to  such  Party.    None  of  the  Confidential  Information	0	c
which  may  be  disclosed  by  a  Disclosing  Party  shall  constitute  any  representation,  warranty,	0	c
assurance, guarantee or inducement by such Disclosing Party to any other Party of any kind, and,	0	c
in  particular,  with  respect  to  the  non-infringement  of  trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  or  any	0	c
other intellectual property rights, or other rights of third persons.	0	s
13.    No Implied Agreement.  Except as provided herein, no Party shall be under any	0	c
legal obligation of any kind whatsoever by virtue of this Agreement.	0	s
14.    Compliance  with  Law.    Nothing  stated  herein  shall  be  construed  to  require  any	0	c
Party to take any action in violation of applicable Laws or regulations.	0	s

amendment,  modification  or  termination  of  this  Agreement  or  any	0	c
provision  hereof,  shall  be  valid  and  effective  only  if  in  writing  and	0	c
executed by all Parties.  A written waiver of a right, remedy or obligation	0	c
under  a  provision  of  this  Agreement  will  not  constitute  a  waiver  of  the	0	c
provision  itself,  a  waiver  of  any  succeeding  right,  remedy  or  obligation	0	c
under the provision, or a waiver of any other right, remedy, or obligation	0	c
under  this  Agreement.    Any  delay  or  failure  by  a  Party  in  enforcing  any	0	c
obligation  or  in  exercising  any  right  or  remedy  shall  not  operate  as  a	0	c
waiver  of  it  or  affect  that  party’s  right  later  to  enforce  the  obligation  or	0	c
exercise the right  or remedy and a single or partial  exercise of a right  of	0	c
remedy  by  a  Party  does  not  preclude  any  further  exercise  of  it  or  the	0	c
exercise of any other right or remedy of that Party.	0	s
c.      Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by an Authority to	0	c
be  invalid,  void  or  unenforceable  in  any  respect  or  with  respect  to	0	c
Confidential  Information,  such  provision  in  all  other  respects  or  with	0	c
respect to all other Confidential Information, as the case may be, and the	0	c
remaining  provisions  with  respect  to  all  Confidential  Information,  shall	0	c
nevertheless  continue  in  full  force  and  effect  without  being  impaired  or	0	c
invalidated and shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by Law.	0	s
d.     Counterparts.    This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  one  or  more	0	c
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which	0	c
shall constitute one and the same instrument.	0	s
e.      Form of Notices.  Every notice, consent or approval required or permitted	0	c
under  this  Agreement  shall  be  valid  only  if  in  writing  and  delivered	0	c
personally,  by  mail,  by  facsimile  or  by  electronic  mail,  and  sent  by  the	0	c
sender  to  each  other  Party  at  its  address  or  number  listed  for  a  Party’s	0	c
Reviewing  Representative.    A  validly  given  notice,  consent  or  approval	0	c
will be effective when received if delivered.	0	s
f.      No  Assignment.    Each  Party  recognizes  that  breach  of  its  obligations	0	c
hereunder shall cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party and agrees	0	c
that in the event of breach, the Disclosing Party shall have in addition to	0	c
any  and  all  remedies  at  Law,  the  right  to  an  injunction,  specific	0	c
performance or other equitable relief.  A party’s liability for breach of this	0	c
Agreement  shall  be  limited  to  the  dollar  amount  of  any  direct  damages	0	c
caused  by  gross  negligence,  intentional  or  deliberate  misconduct  of  such	0	c
Party or of its Reviewing Representative.  The Party shall not be liable for	0	c
special,  incidental,  consequential  and  indirect  damages,  court  costs  and	0	c
attorneys’ fees in connection with any breach hereunder.	0	s

governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware exclusive of the conflicts	0	c
of laws provisions.	0	s
