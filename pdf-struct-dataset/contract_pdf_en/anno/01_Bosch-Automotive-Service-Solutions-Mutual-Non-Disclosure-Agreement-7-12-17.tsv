information,  but  in  no  case  use  less  than  a  reasonable  degree  of  care.  Recipient  agrees  to  limit  disclosure  of	0	c
Confidential Information to employees and employees of Affiliates having a specific need to know such Confidential	0	c
Information for the Purpose and in the case of Affiliates only to the extent that such Affiliate is under obligation to	0	c
hold such information in confidence and is made aware of these terms and conditions. Recipient will not disclose or	0	c
permit access to Confidential Information to contract workers, consultants or contractors of Recipient or its Affiliates	0	c
unless  authorized  by  Disclosing  Party  in  writing  and  on  condition  that  such  persons  are  bound  by  obligations  of	0	c

receive and hold such Confidential Information subject to the terms of this Agreement.	0	s

Confidential Information provided that it does so without breaching the terms of this Agreement.	0	s
