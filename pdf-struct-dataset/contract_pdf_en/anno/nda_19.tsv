WHAT IS A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT?	0	x
A Nondisclosure Agreement, sometimes called a confidentiality agreement, is a contract whereby one or both	0	x
of the parties agree that information, ideas, etc. exchanged between them will not be shared with outsiders.	0	x
Essentially, the information will be treated as confidential.	0	x
WHY USE A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT?	0	x
Nondisclosure agreements (“NDAs”) are generally used when a company or individual has a story idea, or a	0	x
new process, invention, product or even a business plan, that it wants the recipient to evaluate. Generally, this	0	x
is done with an eye toward eventually selling or licensing the material to the recipient. Most of the time the NDA	0	x
restricts  the  recipient's  use  of  the  information  to  evaluation  purposes  only,  requiring  a  license  or  purchase	0	x
before the recipient can use the information in its business.	0	x
NDAs  can  serve  several  purposes.  They  are  used  to  protect  sensitive  creative,  technical  or  commercial	0	x
information from theft. If the information is revealed to a third party the injured party, or used by the recipient	0	x
without permission, he disclosing party has cause to claim a breach of contract and can seek injunctive and	0	x
monetary damages.	0	x
An NDA can also help a discloser avoid forfeiture of patent rights. Under Patent law, once a novel invention is	0	x
publicly available (i.e., “in the public domain”) it is no longer eligible for patent protection.	0	x
Finally,  an  NDA  can  be  used  to  articulate  the  specifics  of  which  information  can  and  cannot  be  disclosed.	0	x
Typically   as  a  result  of  negotiation  to  identify  and  classify  the  nondisclosible  information  as  confidential  or	0	x
proprietary.  Disclosing  parties  seek  the  broadest  definition,  while  recipients  generally  prefer  the  narrowest	0	x
definition. By carefully negotiating the NDA, a recipient of new ideas and information can protect itself against	0	x
later claims of unfair competition or misappropriation.	0	x
WHAT SHOULD AN NDA COVER?	0	x
It is important for the recipient to carefully identify the kinds of material that are NOT covered by the NDA. For	0	x
example, information already known to the recipient, or known to the public should not be subject to treatment	0	x
as confidential. Likewise, information which becomes known to recipient from a third party, and by no fault of	0	x
the  recipient  should  be  excluded.  Finally,  many  NDAs  exclude  information  independently  created  by  the	0	x
recipient.	0	x
An NDA is only as good as the procedures it articulates for the handling of confidential material. Typically, the	0	x
NDA requires that the parties will treat each other's confidential information as though it were its own. This	0	x
assumes, however, that the recipient has established protocols for handling confidential material. Obviously	0	x
where no such protocols already exist, it is prudent to more specifically lay out provisions governing access to	0	x
the confidential information. In many cases, this involves labeling the information as "confidential" and defining	0	x
where it is to be kept, who within the organization may view it, etc.	0	x
Although almost any kind of information can be considered confidential(ideas, stories, character descriptions,	0	x
data,  know-how,  prototypes,  engineering  drawings,  computer  software,  test  results,  tools,  systems,  and	0	x
specifications are but a few illustrations) NDAs are only infrequently used in the entertainment industry. More	0	x
commonly, recipients of literary material, pitches, etc., insist on a comprehensive submission release . (More	0	x
about these in a future article)	0	x
CONCLUSION	0	x
There  are  any  number  of  situations  that  call  for  the  use  of  a  Nondisclosure  agreement.  Knowing  the  basic	0	x
purpose and structure of such agreements is an important first step toward protecting one's intellectual property	0	x
assets.  The  assistance  of  an  experienced  attorney  can  help  avoid  oversights,  ambiguities  and  other  costly	0	x
mistakes.	0	x
