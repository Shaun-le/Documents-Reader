CORPORATE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT	0	x
This Agreement is entered into and made effective as of the date set forth above	0	c
by and between Intel Corporation (hereinafter "Intel"), and the participant	0	c
identified below (hereinafter "Participant"). Unless the Participant indicates	0	c
that this Agreement shall apply only to a specific division or location, this	0	c
Agreement shall apply to the Participant's entire company.	0	c
THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:	0	d
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TRANSMITTAL FORM. The confidential, proprietary	0	c
and trade secret information of the disclosing party (hereinafter	0	c
"Confidential Information") provided hereunder, is that information	0	c
described in the Confidential Information Transmittal Record (CITR) form	0	c
executed from time to time hereafter. CITR's are subject to the terms of	0	c
this Agreement and shall be executed by the parties prior to the	0	c
disclosure of Confidential Information. All information described in a	0	c
CITR and marked with a "confidential," "proprietary," or similar legend	0	c
shall be deemed Confidential Information. All Confidential Information	0	c
received from the disclosing party shall be in tangible form. The CITR	0	c
shall set forth the disclosing party, a description of the Confidential	0	c
Information disclosed, the names of the representatives of the parties and	0	c
the date when the disclosure covered by the CITR commenced.	0	s
OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING PARTY. The receiving party shall not disclose	0	c
Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written	0	c
approval of the disclosing party. The receiving party shall maintain the	0	c
Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that the	0	c
receiving party uses to protect its own similar categories of confidential	0	c
and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care	0	c
under the circumstances. The receiving party shall not make any copies of	0	c
Confidential Information received from the disclosing party except as	0	c
necessary for its employees with a need to know. Any copies which are made	0	c
shall be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked	0	c
"confidential," "proprietary," or with a similar legend.	0	s
PERIOD OF CONFIDENTIALITY. Unless a shorter period is stated in the	0	c
applicable CITR, the disclosing party will not assert any claims against	0	c
the receiving party for disclosures of Confidential Information made more	0	c
than five (5) years from the date of the CITR.	0	s
TERMINATION OF OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. The receiving party shall	0	c
not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is:	0	d
(a)   in the public domain other than by a breach of this Agreement on the	0	c
part of the receiving party; or	0	s
(b)   rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of	0	c
confidentiality; or	0	s
(c)   rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on	0	c
use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party; or	0	s
(d)   independently developed by employees of the receiving party; or	0	c
(e)   generally made available to third parties by the disclosing party	0	s
without restriction on disclosure.	40	s
TITLE. Title or the right to possess Confidential Information as between	0	c
the parties shall remain in the disclosing party.	0	s
NO OBLIGATION OF DISCLOSURE. Neither party has any obligation to disclose	0	c
Confidential Information to the other. Either party may, at any time,	0	c
cease giving Confidential Information to the other party without any	0	c
liability or request in writing the return of Confidential Information	0	c
previously disclosed.	0	s
TERMINATION AND DUTY TO RETURN. Either party may terminate this Agreement	0	c
at any time without cause upon notice to the other party. However, all	0	c
obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this	0	c
Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated, and the disclosing	0	c
party so requests, the receiving party shall promptly return or destroy	0	c
(and certify destruction of) all Confidential Information which it	0	c
received from the disclosing party along with all copies which it made.	0	s
GENERAL.	0	d
(a)   This Agreement is neither intended to nor shall it be construed as	0	c
creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business	0	c
association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell	0	c
products using or incorporating the Confidential Information, nor as	0	c
creating an implied or express license grant from either party to	0	c
the other.	0	s
(b)   The failure of either party to enforce any right resulting from	0	c
breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall	0	c
not be deemed a waiver of any right relating to a subsequent breach	0	c
of such provision or of any other right hereunder.	0	s
(c)   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of	0	c
California.	0	s
(d)   This Agreement, any accompanying CITR and CITRs executed from time	0	c
to time hereafter which incorporate the terms of this Agreement	0	c
constitute the entire agreement, written or verbal, between the	0	c
parties with respect to the disclosure(s) of Confidential	0	c
Information described in each CITR. This Agreement may not be	0	c
amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative	0	c
of the respective parties. Any other agreements between the parties,	0	c
including non-disclosure agreements, shall not be affected by this	0	c
Agreement.	-1	s
