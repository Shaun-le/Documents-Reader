methods of operating, other trade secrets and confidential information regarding	0	c
customers and  employees of the Company or its  customers and other  information	0	c
about the  Company's  Business that is not readily known to the public and gives	0	c
the Company an opportunity to obtain an advantage  over  competitors  who do not	0	c

5. Injunctive  Relief.  ARC acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of	0	c
------------------	0	e
the  covenants set forth in this  Agreement  will cause  irreparable  injury and	0	c

further agrees that in the event of said breach, Belcan, without having to prove	0	c
damages,  shall be entitled to an immediate  restraining order and injunction to	0	c
prevent such  violation or continued  violation,  and to all costs and expenses,	0	c
