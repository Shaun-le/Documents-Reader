WHEREAS, SYMMETREX and Other Party (jointly the "parties") wish to	0	c

such disclosure, each party hereby requires the other party to agree to the	0	c

NOW, THEREFORE, for adequate consideration acknowledged to be received	0	c
by each party, each party, intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as	0	c
follows:	0	d
1. For all purposes of this agreement, the following definitions shall	0	c
apply:	0	d
A. "Confidential Information" of a party shall mean any trade	0	c
secrets, know-how, inventions, products, designs, methods, techniques, systems,	0	c
processes, software programs, works of authorship, business plans, customer	0	c
lists, projects, plans, pricing, proposals and any other information which a	0	c
party discloses to the Recipient Party that: (i) if disclosed in writing is	0	c
clearly marked as confidential or carries a similar legend; or (ii) if disclosed	0	c
verbally or in tangible form is identified as confidential at the time of	0	c
disclosure, then summarized in a writing so marked by the Disclosing Party and	0	c
delivered to the Recipient Party with fifteen (15) days. Confidential	0	c
Information shall also include the terms of this agreement, the fact that the	0	c
information is being made available to the parties hereunder and the fact that	0	c
the parties are contemplating a possible business arrangement.	0	s
B. "Disclosing Party" shall mean, with respect to any	0	c
information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which, directly or	0	c
through one of its agents, discloses such information.	0	s
C. "Recipient Party" shall mean, with respect to any	0	c
information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which receives such	0	c
information.	18	s
2. Each Recipient Party with respect to Confidential Information	0	c
received by it hereunder shall:	0	d
A. Hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and	0	c
protect it in accordance with a standard of care which shall be no less than the	0	c
care it uses to protect its own information of like importance and in no event	0	c
less than reasonable care.	0	s
B. Not use such Confidential Information for any purpose	0	c
except as is necessary for the Evaluation referenced above or as otherwise	0	c
authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party of such information in advance.	0	s
C. Not disclose Confidential Information to any person other	0	c
than to one of the Recipient Party's directors, officers, employees,	0	c
representatives, consultants or agents (collectively called "Representatives")	0	c
who need to know such information for the purposes of the Evaluation, provided	0	c
that each Representative shall be informed, directed and obligated by the	0	c
Recipient Party to treat such information in accordance with the obligations of	0	c
this agreement and the Recipient Party shall be liable for breach of any such	0	c
obligation by any of its Representatives.	0	s
D. Not copy or otherwise duplicate such Confidential	0	c
Information, or knowingly allow anyone else to copy or otherwise duplicate any	0	c
such Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party's prior written	0	c
approval.	38	s
3. Each Recipient Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in the event	0	c
that any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is required to be	0	c
disclosed by the Recipient Party by judicial, administrative or other govern	0	c
mental order. Such notification shall be made reasonably promptly so that the	0	c
Disclosing Party, at its expense, may seek a protective order or other	0	c
appropriate remedy. Provided such notification is given, the Recipient Party is	0	c
hereby authorized to comply with such judicial, administrative or governmental	0	c
order. The Recipient Party shall provide the Disclosing Party reasonable	0	c
cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in connection with any	0	c
protective order or other remedy sought by the Disclosing Party in connection	0	c
with such order.	0	s

4. The obligations imposed on a Recipient Party with respect to	0	c
Confidential Information shall not apply to Confidential Information disclosed	0	c
to it hereunder which (a) the Recipient Party can demonstrate is, at the time of	0	c
disclosure, already known to the Recipient Party, (b) is or becomes generally	0	c
known to the public or is otherwise deemed to be in the public domain through no	0	c
wrongful act of the Recipient Party, (c) is received from a third party who has	0	c
the legal right to so furnish such Confidential Information, or (d) the	0	c
Recipient Party can demonstrate is independently developed by or for the	0	c
Recipient Party without use of Confidential Information.	0	s
5. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party with respect to any	0	c
Confidential Information disclosed by it hereunder, the Recipient Party shall	0	c
return to the Disclosing Party any or all of such information and all copies,	0	c
contracts or other reproductions in whole or in part thereof or, with the	0	c
written permission of such Disclosing Party, effect the destruction of all of	0	c
same and certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party.	0	s
6. Each party acknowledges that the other party has no legal obligation	0	c
pursuant to this agreement to disclose information to it hereunder but is doing	0	c
so as an accommodation to the Recipient Party in reliance upon the terms of this	0	c
agreement and that all information received by the Recipient Party hereunder	0	c
cannot be relied upon as a representation or warranty of the Disclosing Party	0	c
and, accordingly, no Disclosing Party shall be liable for any reliance upon any	0	c
information disclosed by it hereunder, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by	0	c
the Disclosing Party.	0	s
7. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as granting	0	c
to either party any right, title or interest in any information disclosed	0	c
hereunder to it, except for the limited right to use and disclosure as expressly	0	c
permitted hereunder.	0	s
8. Each Recipient Party shall on any copies it may make of any	0	c
information received hereunder maintain any and all copyright, patent or	0	c
trademark notices which may appear on such information when so received.	0	s
9. Each party represents that the disclosure by it of information	0	c
hereunder does not violate the rights of any other entity.	0	s
10. If either Party breaches its promises made in this Agreement, the	0	c
non-breaching Party will have available to it all remedies available under law.	0	s
11. This agreement shall become effective on the date it is fully	0	c
executed and delivered by both parties and both this agreement and the duties of	0	c
the parties hereunder shall continue for a period of two years after the last	0	c
disclosure of information made hereunder.	0	s
12. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of	0	c
each party and its successors. No representations have been made to induce	0	c
either party to enter this agreement other than those expressly stated herein.	0	c
This agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or expressions	0	c
of intent or understanding and is the entire agreement between the parties with	0	c
respect to its subject matter. Neither party shall be charged with any waiver of	0	c
any provision of this agreement unless such waiver is evidenced by a writing	0	c
signed by an authorized officer of such party and any such waiver shall be	0	c
limited to the terms of such writing. This agreement shall not be changed or	0	c
terminated, except by a writing signed by an authorized officer of Symmetrex and	0	c
an authorized officer of Other Party. This agreement shall be governed by the	0	c
laws of the State of Florida, without regard to the conflicts of law principles	0	c
of that state.	-1	s
