NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other	0	c

1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. Commencing on the date hereof and ending on	0	c
the last day of the Restricted Period (as defined below), Ermilio covenants and	0	c

offer Ermilio an extension ("Extension") of his employment agreement, of even	0	c
date herewith, with SHRA beyond the expiration date of the original one-year	0	c
term ("Expiration Date"), then the Restricted Period shall be one (1) year from	0	c

Restricted Period shall extend until the later of (i) two (2) years from the	0	c
date hereof and (ii) one (1) year from the date of his termination of employment	0	c
with the SHRA, or any Affiliate of SHRA, for any reason.	35	s
2 Nondisclosure. Ermilio understands and agrees that the business of the	0	c
Purchaser and its Affiliates is based upon specialized work and Confidential	0	c
Information (as hereinafter defined). Ermilio agrees that during the Restricted	0	c
Period, he shall keep secret all such Confidential Information and that he will	0	c
not, directly or indirectly, use for his own benefit or for the benefit of	0	c
others nor Disclose (as hereinafter defined), without the prior written consent	0	c
of the Purchaser, any Confidential Information. At any time upon the Purchaser's	0	c
request, Ermilio shall turn over to the Purchaser all books, notes, memoranda,	0	c
manuals, notebooks, records and other documents made, compiled by, delivered to,	0	c
or in the possession or control of Ermilio containing or concerning any	0	c
Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, in any form or format,	0	c
including any computer hard disks, wherever located, containing any such	0	c
information, it being agreed that the same and all information contained therein	0	c
are at all times the exclusive property of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.	0	b
As used in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" means any	0	c
information or compilation of information not generally known to the public or	0	c
the industry, that is proprietary or confidential to the Purchaser, its	0	c
2	0	e
<PAGE>	0	e
Affiliates and/or those doing business with the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates,	0	c
including but not limited to know-how, process, techniques, methods, plans,	0	c
specifications, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, supplier lists, customer	0	c
lists, mailing lists, financial information, business plans and/or policies,	0	c
methods of operation, sales and marketing plans and any other information	0	c
acquired or developed by Ermilio in the course of his past, present and future	0	c
dealings with the Purchaser and its Affiliates, which is not readily available	0	c
to the public.	0	b
"Confidential Information" does not include any information, datum or	0	c
fact: (a) currently available to the public as of the date hereof; (b) after it	0	c
becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach hereof or	0	c
other wrongful conduct by Executive; (c) after it becomes available to Executive	0	c
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company or its	0	c
Affiliates or a person or entity breaching his or its confidentiality agreement	0	c
or other relationship of confidence with the Company or its Affiliates; or (d)	0	c
developed independently by Executive without any reference to or use whatsoever	0	c
of any Confidential Information of the Company or its Affiliates.	0	b
As used in this Agreement, the term "Disclose" means to reveal, deliver,	0	c
divulge, disclose, publish, copy, communicate, show, allow or permit access to,	0	c
or otherwise make known or available to any third party, any of the Confidential	0	c
Information.	0	s
3 Blue Pencil Doctrine. In the event that the restrictive covenants contained in	0	c
Section 1 and/or Section 2 of this Agreement shall be found by a court of	0	c
competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable by reason of such restrictive	0	c
covenants extending for too great a period of time or over too great a	0	c
geographic area or by reason of such restrictive covenants being too extensive	0	c
in any other respect, then such restrictive covenant shall be deemed modified to	0	c
the minimum extent necessary to make such restrictive covenant reasonable and	0	c
enforceable under the circumstances.	0	s
4 Injunctive Relief. If Ermilio shall breach or threaten to breach any of the	0	c
provisions of Section 1 and/or Section 2, in addition to and without limiting	0	c
any other remedies available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, the Purchaser	0	c
shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in any court to restrain	0	c
any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce the provisions of Section 1	0	c
and/or Section 2, as the case may be. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that there	0	c
is no adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened breach and, in	0	c
the event that any proceeding is brought seeking injunctive relief, Ermilio	0	c
shall not use as a defense thereto that there is an adequate remedy at law.	0	s
5 Reasonableness of Covenants. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that the	0	c
restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are a necessary inducement to	0	c
Purchaser purchasing Ermilio's ownership interests in the Companies, and that	0	c
the scope (geographic and otherwise) and period of duration of the restrictive	0	c
covenants contained in this Agreement are both fair and reasonable and that the	0	c
interests sought to be protected by the Purchaser are legitimate business	0	c
interests entitled to be protected. Ermilio further acknowledges and agrees that	0	c
the Purchaser would not have purchased Ermilio's ownership interests in the	0	c
Companies pursuant to the Purchase Agreement unless Ermilio entered into this	0	c
Agreement.	0	s
