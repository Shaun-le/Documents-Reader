covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement are (i) reasonable in all	0	c

necessary to protect the value of Dollar Tree, and (iii) are not unduly harsh	0	c
upon Selling Shareholder's ability to earn a livelihood.  Selling Shareholder	0	c
represents that upon careful review, Selling Shareholder knows of no reason why	0	c
any agreement, covenant, or restriction contained in this Agreement is not	0	c
reasonable and enforceable.	0	s
8.2  If any provision of this Agreement shall be found by any	0	c
arbitration panel or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or	0	c
unenforceable, such provision shall be replaced by such panel or court by a	0	c

Non-Competition Agreement -- Page 5	0	e
<PAGE>	0	e
economic, business and other purposes of the invalid or unenforceable provision	0	c
and, as modified, shall be enforced as any other provision hereof, all other	0	c

10.  NO DEFENSE.  The existence of any claim or cause of action of the	0	c
Selling Shareholder against Dollar Tree, whether predicated on this Agreement	0	c
or not, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Dollar Tree of the	0	c
restrictions, covenants and agreements contained herein.	0	s
11.  AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION.  Subject to applicable law, this	0	c
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented only by written agreement	0	c

12.  WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE; CONSENTS.  Any failure of the Selling	0	c
Shareholder to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition	0	c
herein may be waived only by a writing signed by Dollar Tree only and such	0	c
waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,	0	c
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel	0	c
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.	0	s
13.  NOTICES.  All claims, notices, requests, demands and other	0	c
communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be	0	c
