Attn:  Joseph M. Saggese	0	x
Chairman	0	x
Dear Mr. Saggese:	0	x
Melamine Chemicals, Inc. ("MCI") and Borden Chemical, Inc. (the "Company") are	0	c
prepared to engage in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business	0	c
combination involving the Company and MCI (the "Transaction"), and during the	0	c
course of such discussions MCI may disclose and make available to the Company	0	c
certain information concerning MCI's business, prospects, financial condition,	0	c
operations, technology, assets and liabilities.  All such information furnished	0	c
to the Company or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of MCI	0	c
(irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is	0	c
furnished prior to, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses,	0	c
compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other	0	c
documents prepared by the Company or its Representatives containing or based in	0	c
whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to	0	c
herein as the "Confidential Information."  As a condition to being furnished the	0	c
Confidential Information, the Company agrees as follows:	0	d
1.   NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  (a) the Company shall (i) use	0	c
the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a	0	c
possible Transaction and for no other competitive or other purpose; (ii)	0	c
not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for	0	c
disclosures to its directors, officers, employees and representatives of	0	c
its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers and	0	c
attorneys) acting on	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
its behalf (such directors, officers, employees and representatives being	0	c
referred to hereinafter collectively as its "Representatives") who in each	0	c
case, in the Company's reasonable judgment, need to know such information	0	c
for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction; provided, however,	0	c
that prospective financing sources shall not be considered	0	c
"Representatives" to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed in	0	c
accordance with this paragraph 1 unless specifically requested by the	0	c
Company and consented to by MCI in writing; (iii) inform its	0	c
Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information	0	c
and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information	0	c
confidentially; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary	0	c
to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its	0	c
Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach	0	c
of this Agreement (the "Agreement") by its Representatives.	0	b
(b)  If the Company or its Representatives is requested (by interrogatories,	0	c
requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand	0	c
or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed	0	c
that the Company will provide MCI with prompt notice of such request so	0	c
that MCI may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the	0	c
Company's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.  The Company	0	c
and its Representatives may disclose without liability hereunder only that	0	c
portion of the Confidential Information that the Company is advised by	0	c
written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided	0	c
that the Company gives MCI written notice of the information to be	0	c
disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and,  upon	0	c
MCI's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that	0	c
confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.	0	s
2.   NON-DISCLOSURE OF NEGOTIATIONS OR AGREEMENTS.  Except as required by law,	0	c
neither the Company nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person	0	c
the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or	0	c
agreements concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation	0	c
any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any	0	c
similar terms, agreements or understandings between the Company and MCI	0	c
with respect thereto, or that the Company has received from MCI	0	c
Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of	0	c
the other, which consent will not be withheld unreasonably.	0	s
3.   RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  All written Confidential Information	0	c
delivered by or on behalf of MCI to the Company pursuant to this Agreement	0	c
shall be and remain the property of MCI and upon the written request of	0	c
MCI, the Company shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information	0	c
and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof,	0	c
(ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses,	0	c
compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or	0	c
containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions	0	c
and extracts thereof, and (iii) upon written request by MCI provide a	0	c
certificate to MCI certifying that the foregoing	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an	0	c
authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding	0	c
the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Company and	0	c
its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and	0	c
other obligations hereunder, until the expiration of three years from the	0	c
date of this Agreement, unless a lesser duration is specified herein.	0	s
4.   INFORMATION NOT DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The term "Confidential	0	c
Information" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally	0	c
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the	0	c
Company or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; or (ii) was	0	c
or becomes available to the Company from a source other than MCI or its	0	c
Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the Company to	0	c
be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to MCI or its Representatives	0	c
or (iii) was already known to the Company at the time of its disclosure by	0	c
MCI.	0	s
5.   NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.  Neither MCI nor any of its respective	0	c
officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any	0	c
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and	0	c
completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no	0	c
liability shall result to MCI from its use, except as set forth in a	0	c
definitive agreement for a Transaction.  Only the representations and	0	c
warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when,	0	c
as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions	0	c
as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.	0	s
6.   NO AGREEMENT.  MCI has the absolute right to determine what information,	0	c
properties and personnel it wishes to make available to the Company.	0	c
Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between the Company	0	c
and MCI has been executed and delivered, neither MCI, the Company nor any	0	c
of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of	0	c
any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this	0	c
Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such	0	c
Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically	0	c
agreed to herein.  Each party further acknowledges and agrees that each	0	c
party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all	0	c
proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard	0	c
to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the	0	c
other party at any time.	0	s
7.   CONTACT PERSONS; NO SOLICITATION.  All requests by the Company for	0	c
Confidential Information, meetings with personnel or inspection of	0	c
properties and all other	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
communications regarding a possible Transaction shall be made only to the	0	c
contacts designated by MCI (the "Contact Persons"). The Company agrees	0	c
that, for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, it will	0	c
not initiate or maintain contact (except in the ordinary course of	0	c
business) with any director, officer, employee, distributor or customer of	0	c
MCI regarding MCI's business operations, prospects or finances, except as	0	c
may be permitted by the Contact Persons for due diligence purposes. It is	0	c
expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to limit the right	0	c
of the parties to compete with one another in the ordinary course. The	0	c
Company further agrees that, for a period of two years from the date	0	c
hereof, it will not directly or indirectly offer employment to (other than	0	c
by means of a general advertisement) or hire any of MCI's employees with	0	c
whom it has had contact during the process contemplated by this Agreement.	0	s
8.   NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION.  MCI has outstanding publicly-held securities and	0	c
the Confidential Information contains material non-public information.  The	0	c
Company acknowledges that it is (i) aware, and has advised or will advise	0	c
its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any	0	c
person in possession of material non-public information about a company	0	c
from purchasing or selling securities of such company, and from	0	s
communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in	0	c
which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell	0	c
such securities and (ii) familiar with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,	0	c
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder,	0	c
and the Company agrees that it will neither use nor permit any of its	0	c
Representatives to use any Confidential Information in violation of such	0	c
Act or rules or regulations, including without limitation Rule 10b-5.	0	s
9.   STANDSTILL.  The Company agrees that, until the expiration of two years	0	c
from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written invitation (on	0	c
an unsolicited basis) of MCI's Board of Directors, it and its affiliates	0	c
will not (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal	0	c
or offer or otherwise seek to acquire, directly or indirectly, any	0	c
securities (or rights in respect thereof), assets or property of MCI  or	0	c
any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control	0	c
thereof, whether such agreements or proposals or offers are made with or to	0	c
MCI or any of its subsidiaries (or a successor thereto or person in control	0	c
thereof) or a third party; (ii) enter into or agree, offer, seek or propose	0	c
to enter into or otherwise be involved in or part of, directly or	0	c
indirectly, any merger, acquisition transaction or other business	0	c
combination relating to MCI or any of its subsidiaries or any of their	0	c
respective assets; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or	0	c
indirectly, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the	0	c
proxy rules under the Exchange Act) to vote, or seek to advise or influence	0	c
any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of MCI or	0	c
any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control	0	c
thereof; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" (within the	0	c
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting	0	c
securities of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or	0	c
person in control thereof; (v) seek or propose, alone or in concert	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
with others, to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or	0	c
policies of MCI; (vi) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions,	0	c
negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other person (except	0	c
internal discussions and planning activities involving its Representatives)	0	c
with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such	0	c
activities to any other person (other than its Representatives); (vii)	0	c
directly or indirectly advise, encourage, assist, act as a financing source	0	c
for or otherwise invest in any other person in connection with any of the	0	c
foregoing; or (viii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement	0	c
inconsistent with the foregoing. The Company also agrees that, during such	0	c
two-year period, neither it nor any of its affiliates will: (i) request MCI	0	c
or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (1) amend or waive any	0	c
provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (2) otherwise	0	c
consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph	0	c
(including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to MCI	0	c
or any of it's subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to require	0	c
MCI to make a public announcement regarding (1) such initiative, (2) any of	0	c
the activities referred to in this paragraph, (3) the possibility of a	0	c
Transaction or any similar transaction or (4) the possibility of the	0	c
Company's or any other person's acquiring control of MCI, whether by means	0	c
of a business combination or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing	0	c
provisions of this paragraph 9, the Company's chief executive officer may	0	c
contact MCI's chief executive officer for the purpose of expressing	0	c
continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless	0	c
invited to do so by MCI's chief executive officer, no offer or proposal	0	c
shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration	0	c
by MCI or its Board of Directors.	0	s
10.  PERSON.  The term "person" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted	0	c
broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group,	0	c
partnership, governmental body or other entity or individual.	0	s
11.  NO WAIVER.  No failure or delay by MCI  in exercising any right, power or	0	c
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single	0	c
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof,	0	c
or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.	0	s
12.  REMEDIES.  It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a	0	c
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Company and that	0	c
MCI shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance	0	c
and injunction, as a remedy for any such	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the	0	c
exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by the Company but shall	0	c
be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to MCI,	0	c
including remedies pursuant to applicable laws relating to trade secrets.	0	s
13.  BENEFITS; GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement is for the benefit of MCI and its	0	c
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents and	0	c
its respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by and	0	c
construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws and not the	0	c
choice of law rules of the State of Louisiana.	0	s
14.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,	0	c
each of which shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts	0	c
together shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.	0	s
15.  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of	0	c
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or	0	c
unenforceability shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof	0	c
or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and such invalid or	0	c
unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum	0	c
extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability.	0	s
16.  MODIFICATIONS.  No provision of this Agreement may be waived, amended or	0	c
modified except by the written agreement of the Company and MCI.	-1	s

copy of this letter to the undersigned, whereupon this letter shall become a	0	c
binding agreement between us.	-1	s
