CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT	0	x
THIS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of January 31, 2001 by and between	0	c
Sunglass Hut International, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Sunglass Hut"), and	0	c
Luxottica Group S.p.A, an Italian corporation ("Luxottica") (Sunglass Hut and	0	c
Luxottica are collectively referred to herein as the "Parties").	0	s
WHEREAS, the Parties wish to provide for the disclosure of information	0	c
relating to Sunglass Hut and maintenance of the confidentiality thereof with	0	c
respect of the evaluation by Luxottica of a possible transaction (the "Possible	0	c
Transaction");	0	s
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration the	0	c
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be	0	c
legally bound, hereby agree as follows:	0	d
1. DEFINITIONS. The following terms are defined as follows:	0	d
(a) "Evaluation Material" means any oral or written information concerning	0	c
Sunglass Hut, its subsidiaries, business, markets, products, prospects or	0	c
finances furnished by it (in such capacity, the "Provider") or any of its	0	c
Representatives (as defined below) to Luxottica (in such capacity, the	0	c
"Recipient") or any of its Representatives, except information which: (i) is or	0	c
becomes generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of	0	c
a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Recipient or any of its	0	c
Representatives who received such information pursuant hereto); (ii) is or	0	c
becomes available to the Recipient or any of its Representatives on a	0	c
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Provider or any of its	0	c
Representatives; provided, that such source is not and was not bound by a	0	c
confidentiality agreement with, or other similar obligation to, the Provider of	0	c
which the Recipient or any of its Representatives are aware; or (iii) has been	0	c
independently acquired or developed by the Recipient or any of its	0	c
Representatives without violating any of its obligations under this Agreement.	0	s
(b) A "Representative" of a Party includes any officer, director,	0	c
shareholder, employee, advisor, attorney, consultant or agent of such Party.	15	s
2. USE OF EVALUATION MATERIAL. Any Evaluation Material provided to the	0	c
Recipient hereunder will be used by the Recipient and its Representatives solely	0	c
for the purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction and will not be used by	0	c
the Recipient in any way detrimental to the Provider or its stockholders. The	0	c
Recipient will maintain the strict confidentiality of any Evaluation Material	0	c
provided to it or any of its Representatives by the other Party or any of the	0	c
other Party's Representatives and will not disclose any part of it to any other	0	c
person; provided, however, that it may disclose any such Evaluation Material or	0	c
portions thereof to those of its Representatives who need to know such	0	c
information in order to assist the Recipient in evaluating the advisability of	0	c
entering into the Possible Transaction and it may disclose any such Evaluation	0	c
Material in accordance with Paragraph 5 hereof.	0	s
3. REPRESENTATIVES. The Recipient will (a) provide the other Party with a	0	c
list of its Representatives who are given access to any Evaluation Material, (b)	0	c
inform each such Representative of the terms of this Agreement, and (c) obtain	0	c
the agreement of each such Representative to abide by the terms of this	0	c
Agreement. Each Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by	0	c
any of its Representatives.	0	s
4. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless	0	c
the other Party from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities and	0	c
costs that any other Party may sustain or incur as a result of any breach of	0	c
this Agreement by such Party or any of its Representatives.	0	s
5. SUBPOENAS, ETC. If the Recipient or any of its Representatives becomes	0	c
required by law or applicable legal process (by deposition, interrogatory,	0	c
request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process)	0	c
to disclose any Evaluation Material furnished by the Provider,	0	c
<PAGE>	0	e
the Recipient will provide the Provider with prompt prior written notice of such	0	c
requirement and the terms of and circumstances surrounding such requirement so	0	c
that the Provider may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, or	0	c
waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Recipient will	0	c
provide such cooperation with respect to obtaining a protective order or other	0	c
remedy as the Provider may reasonably request. If such protective order or other	0	c
remedy is not obtained, or if the Provider is required to waive compliance with	0	c
the provisions hereof, Recipient will furnish only that portion of such	0	c
Evaluation Material which, as it is advised in a written opinion by its counsel,	0	c
is legally required to furnish and will exercise all reasonable efforts to	0	c
obtain an order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment, if	0	c
available, will be accorded such Evaluation Material.	0	s
6. TERMINATION. If any Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with	0	c
a Possible Transaction, it will promptly advise the other Parties of that	0	c
decision. In such event, the Recipient promptly will return to the Provider all	0	c
copies of any Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of any	0	c
of its Representatives furnished by such Provider or any of its Representatives,	0	c
and the Recipient will destroy all analyses, compilations, studies or other	0	c
documents prepared by it or any of its Representatives or for their use	0	c
containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material, whether in digital, written or	0	c
other form. Any destruction required pursuant to this Paragraph 6 will be	0	c
certified in writing to the Provider by an authorized officer supervising such	0	c
destruction.	0	s
7. NON-DISCLOSURE. Without the prior written consent of the other Party,	0	c
each Party will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any	0	c
person that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place	0	c
concerning a Possible Transaction, that such Party has requested or received	0	c
Evaluation Material from the other Party, or any of the terms, conditions or	0	c
other facts with respect to any Possible Transaction, including the status	0	c
thereof.	0	s
8. NO SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Each Party covenants that for a period of	0	c
two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, such Party will not,	0	c
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the other	0	c
Party or any of the other Party's subsidiaries with whom such Party has had	0	c
contact or who became known to such Party in connection with its consideration	0	c
of the Possible Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision	0	c
will not prevent a Party from employing any employee of the other Party who	0	c
contacts the prospective employer Party on his or her own initiative without any	0	c
direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the prospective	0	c
employer Party, or prevent a general solicitation conducted in the ordinary	0	c
course of business and not directed specifically at the employees of the other	0	c
Party.	0	s
9. ACCURACY OF MATERIALS. The Provider does not make any representation or	0	c
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the	0	c
Evaluation Materials provided or to be provided by it or any of its	0	c
Representatives. Neither the Provider nor any of its Representatives will have	0	c
any liability to the Recipient or any person resulting from the Recipient's use	0	c
of any Evaluation Material provided by the Provider or any of its	0	c
Representatives or the contents thereof or from any action taken or any inaction	0	c
occurring in reliance thereon.	0	s
10. NO COMMITMENT. No contract or agreement providing for any transaction	0	c
or other arrangement between the Parties exists. Neither Party nor any of their	0	c
respective stockholders or owners will have any legal obligation of any kind	0	c
whatsoever with respect to any transaction or other arrangement by virtue of	0	c
this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to any	0	c
transaction or other arrangement except, in the case of this Agreement, for the	0	c
matters specifically agreed to herein. Each Party will be free to conduct or	0	c
terminate the process whereby it may enter into any transaction or other	0	c
arrangement as such Party in its sole discretion will determine. No Party will	0	c
have any claims whatsoever against the other Party or any of the other Party's	0	c
Representatives arising out or relating to any transaction or other arrangement.	0	c
Neither this Paragraph 10 nor any other provision in this Agreement can be	0	c
waived or amended except by written consent of both Parties.	0	s

11. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. Each Party acknowledges that it is	0	c
aware (and that its Representatives who are apprised of a Proposed Transaction	0	c
have been, or upon being so apprised will be, advised) of the restrictions	0	c
imposed by certain securities laws on a person possessing material non-public	0	c
information about certain companies and agrees to comply with such laws.	0	s
12. EQUITABLE REMEDIES. The Parties acknowledge that money damages are an	0	c
inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of	0	c
ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered in the event that this	0	c
Agreement is breached. Therefore, each Party will be entitled to equitable	0	c
relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any	0	c
breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other Party or any of its	0	c
Representatives, in addition to all other remedies available to such Party at	0	c
law or in equity.	0	s
13. NO WAIVERS. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any	0	c
right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will	0	c
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise	0	c
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.	0	s
14. INTEGRATION. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and	0	c
understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and	0	c
supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings	0	c
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.	0	s
15. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties and	0	c
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of	0	c
Florida. All Parties' obligations under this Agreement will expire one year from	0	c
the date of this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of	0	c
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void	0	c
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and	0	c
restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will in	0	c
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.	-1	s
