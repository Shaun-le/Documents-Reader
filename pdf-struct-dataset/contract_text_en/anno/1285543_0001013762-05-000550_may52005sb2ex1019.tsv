The Recipient may disclose the Information  only to its officers,  employees and	0	c

Information,  and Recipient  shall be responsible  for any disclosure by them in	0	c
violation of this Agreement.	0	s
4. Nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall be construed by  implication  or	0	c
otherwise,  as an obligation to enter into any further agreement relating to the	0	c
Information or as grant of a license to use the Information or any  intellectual	0	c
property  rights therein other than for evaluation  and  consultation  purposes.	0	c
Disclosing  Party retains any and all proprietary and ownership rights it has in	0	c

years after the Effective Date. The  confidentiality  and use restrictions  with	0	c
respect  to  Proprietary  and  Confidential   Information   disclosed  prior  to	0	c
termination shall survive for a period of two (2) years after the termination.	0	s
6. Upon  completion  of the aforesaid  evaluation  and in the absence of further	0	c
agreement of the parties,  the Recipient shall cease all use and make no further	0	c
use of the  Information.  At Disclosing  Party's  request,  the Recipient  shall	0	c
promptly  return or destroy all  Information  disclosed by Disclosing  Party and	0	c
shall retain no copies.	0	s
7. The parties hereby  acknowledge  and agree that in the event of any violation	0	c
or a threatened  violation of this  Agreement by the  Recipient,  the Disclosing	0	c
Party  shall be  authorized  and  entitled  to seek from any court of  competent	0	c
jurisdiction  preliminary and permanent  injunctive relief. This Agreement shall	0	c
be  governed  by the law of the United  States of  America  and the State of New	0	c

survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.	-1	s
