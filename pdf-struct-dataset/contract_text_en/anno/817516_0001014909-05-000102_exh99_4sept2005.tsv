in accordance with Sections 4.4 and 6.9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller	0	c
Parties agree to enter into this Agreement;	0	s
WHEREAS, the Seller Parties acknowledge that the covenants of the Seller	0	c

Asset Purchase Agreement; and	0	s
WHEREAS, the Seller Parties possess substantial and intimate knowledge of	0	c

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants	0	c
and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:	0	d
1. Non-Competition. For a period of four years from the date of this	0	c
Agreement (the "Restricted Period"), Seller Parties shall not, directly or	0	c
indirectly, engage in The Company's Business (as hereinafter defined) or,	0	c
without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, own	0	c
an interest in, manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial	0	c
or other assistance to or participate in, as a partner, stockholder, consultant	0	c

conducted as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term the	0	c
"The Company's Business" shall mean any business anywhere in the world that	0	c
provides products or services of the kind provided by the Business (as defined	0	c
in the Recitals of the Asset Purchase Agreement) as of the Closing Date.	0	c

of any competitor which are listed on any national securities exchange,	0	c
automated securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or traded actively in the	0	c
national over-the-counter market (in each case including any foreign equivalent)	0	c
shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Agreement.	0	s

2. Confidentiality. During the Restricted Period and at all times	0	c
thereafter, Seller Parties will keep and hold all Confidential Information (as	0	c
hereinafter defined) in strict confidence, and will not use or disclose in any	0	c
way any of such Confidential Information without the prior express written	0	c
consent of the Buyer Parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term	0	c
"Confidential Information" shall mean all trade secrets and confidential or	0	c
proprietary information (and any tangible representation thereof) owned,	0	c
possessed or used in connection with The Company Business or by the Buyer	0	c
Parties and its Affiliates; provided, however, that "Confidential Information"	0	c
does not include information which is or becomes generally available to the	0	c
public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller Party..	0	s
3. Non-Solicitation. During the Restricted Period, Seller Parties agree	0	c
that they will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of	0	c
conducting or engaging in any business that competes with The Company Business,	0	c
call upon, solicit, advise or otherwise do, or attempt to do, business with any	0	c
customers of the Company engaged prior to the Closing Date (provided that Simtek	0	c
shall have the right to do business with any of its current or former	0	c
customers), or interfere with or attempt to interfere with any officers,	0	c
employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, induce or attempt to induce any	0	c
of them to leave the employ of the Buyer Parties or violate the terms of their	0	c
Contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Buyer Parties, or, without the	0	c
prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire,	0	c
hire or employ, whether as an employee, director, contractor, consultant or	0	c
otherwise any officers, employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, unless	0	c
such Person's employment is terminated by the Seller Parties or its Affiliate;	0	c
provided, however, that this Section 3 shall not prohibit general solicitations	0	c
of or advertisements for employment by the Seller Parties that are not generally	0	c
directed at any officers, employees, representatives or agents of the Buyer	0	c
Parties, so long as the Seller Parties do not hire any such Person who responds	0	c
to any such general solicitation or advertisement.	0	s
4. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term	0	c
"Person" shall mean an individual, a corporation, an association, a partnership,	0	c
an estate, a trust and any other entity or organization, (b) the term	0	c
"Affiliate" shall mean with respect to any Person, any Person which, directly or	0	c
indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such	0	c
Person, and (c) the term "control" (including, with correlative meaning, the	0	c
terms "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to	0	c
any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct	0	c
or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether	0	c
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.	0	s
5. Extension of Restricted Period. The Restricted Period shall be extended	0	c
by the length of any period during which the Seller Parties are in breach of the	0	c
terms of this Agreement.	0	s

7. No Waiver. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only	0	c
by a written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance. The failure of	0	c
any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement	0	c
shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any	0	c
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of	0	c
such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any	0	c
breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of	0	c
any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. The rights and remedies herein	0	c
provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any	0	c
party may otherwise have at law or in equity.	0	s

enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Delaware,	0	c
without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.	0	s

10. Construction of Agreement. A reference to a Section shall mean a	0	c
Section in this Agreement unless otherwise expressly stated. The titles and	0	c
headings herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner	0	c
limit the construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole.	0	c
The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed	0	c
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."	0	c
11. Entire Agreement, Assignability, etc. This Agreement and the Asset	0	c
Purchase Agreement and the documents and other agreements among the parties	0	c
hereto and thereto as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein	0	c
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject	0	c
matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both	0	c
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.	0	c
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties	0	c
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement is not	0	c
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or	0	c
remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein and shall not	0	c
be assignable by operation of law or otherwise.	0	s
12. Validity. The Seller Parties have independently consulted with their	0	c
counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this	0	c
Agreement are reasonable and proper. In the event that any provision of this	0	c
Agreement shall be determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extension for	0	c
too great a period of time or over too large a geographic area or over too great	0	c
a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum	0	c
period of time, geographic area or range of activities as to which it may be	0	c
enforceable. If, after application of the preceding sentence, any provision of	0	c
this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or otherwise	0	c
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity, legality and	0	c
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected	0	c
thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, any invalid, illegal	0	c
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be severable, and after any	0	c
such severance, all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and	0	c
effect.	0	s

13. Remedies. Seller Parties recognize that money damages alone would not	0	c
adequately compensate Buyer Parties and its Affiliates in the event of breach by	0	c
Seller Parties of this Agreement, and Seller Parties therefore agree that, in	0	c
addition to all other remedies available to Buyer Parties and its Affiliates, at	0	c
law, in equity or otherwise, Buyer Parties and its Affiliates shall be entitled	0	c
to injunctive relief for the enforcement hereof. All rights and remedies	0	c
hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to and not exclusive of any other	0	c
rights and remedies available, at law, in equity, by agreement or otherwise.	0	s
14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more	0	c
counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.	-1	s
