HOWEVER, that in such event such party will notify the other party that it	0	c
intends, as a preliminary matter, to take such action and the outside securities	0	c

counsel of the other party before any definitive decision is made on the	0	c
disclosure.	0	s
3. Recipients shall use Confidential Information solely for the purpose	0	c
(the "Permitted Purpose") specified at the end of this Agreement.	0	s

possession prior to disclosure by Discloser	0	c
hereunder;	0	s
(b)      was generally known, in the trade or business in	0	c
which it is practiced by Recipient or its	0	c
Representatives at the time of disclosure to	0	c

agents or independent contractors in violation of	0	c

6. Recipient agrees not to reproduce or copy by any means Confidential	0	c
Information, except as reasonably required to accomplish such Recipient's	0	c
Permitted Purpose. Upon written demand by Discloser at any time, Recipient shall	0	c
return promptly to Discloser or destroy, at Recipient's option, all tangible	0	c
materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information except that	0	c
Recipient's counsel may, upon written notice to Disclosure's counsel, retain a	0	c
single copy of Confidential Information in its records solely for use in dispute	0	c
resolution or as otherwise required by law. Recipient shall not remove any	0	c
proprietary rights legend from, and shall, upon Discloser's reasonable written	0	c
request, add an appropriate proprietary legend to, materials disclosing or	0	c
embodying Confidential Information.	0	s
7. In the event that Recipient is ordered to disclose Discloser's	0	c
Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental request,	0	c
requirement or order, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and take	0	c
reasonable steps at Discloser's expense to assist Discloser in contesting such	0	c
request, requirement or order or otherwise protecting Discloser's rights.	0	s
8. Discloser understands that Recipient is an ice cream manufacturer	0	c
and engaged in distribution (and with arrangements with distributors or	0	c
subdistributors) and that planned activities in all such areas that are	0	c
independently developed, pursued or acquired by the Recipient may contain ideas	0	c
and concepts similar or identical to those contained in Discloser's Confidential	0	c
Information. Discloser agrees that entering into this Agreement shall not	0	c
preclude Recipient from developing, pursuing or acquiring projects similar to	0	c
Discloser's, without obligation to Discloser, provided Recipient does not breach	0	c
its obligations to Discloser under this Agreement or use the Confidential	0	c
Information to develop or pursue such projects. The parties agree that unless	0	c
and until a definitive written agreement between the Company and Ben & Jerry's	0	c
has been executed and delivered relating to a specific transaction (which	0	c
agreement contains customary conditions, representations, warranties and	0	c
covenants for an agreement of that kind), neither party shall be under any	0	c
obligation whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this or	0	c
any written or oral communication with respect to such a transaction by it or	0	c
any of its respective Representatives.	0	s
