1. The parties intend to pursue a Pilot Study to test its functionality,	0	c
performance and reliability to determine the applicability of this technology to	0	c
plastic surgery applications, which will be carried out by Dr. Yuan Liu	0	c
utilizing ABP's BioScanIR(R) system consisting of the following elements: (i)	0	c

black body; (ii) proprietary DIRI(R) software for control of system components,	0	c
data acquisition, data processing, data archiving and reporting; and (iii)	0	c
applications software packages (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the	0	c
"System") as further defined in the Pilot Site Agreement between the parties	0	c
(hereinafter referred to as the "Pilot Study"), and in the course of which the	0	c
parties may exchange Proprietary Information, as hereinafter defined. The	0	c
parties further desire to protect such Proprietary Information from unauthorized	0	c
disclosure and use under the terms and conditions herein.	0	s
2. For purposes of this Agreement, Proprietary Information shall mean,	0	c
without limitation, computer programs, code, algorithms, names and expertise of	0	c
employees and consultants, formulas, processes, inventions, schematics and other	0	c
technical, business, financial, pricing and product development plans, forecasts	0	c
and strategies, together with any analysis or tangible embodiments of the	0	c
Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information created by the Receiving Party.	0	c
Proprietary Information shall be designated as such in writing by the Disclosing	0	c
Party by appropriate legend or stamp, or, if first disclosed in a non-written or	0	c
other non-tangible form, Proprietary Information shall be identified by the	0	c
Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure as being disclosed in confidence and	0	c
shall be reduced to tangible form and marked as confidential or proprietary and	0	c
such tangible form shall be delivered to the Receiving Party within thirty (30)	0	c
days after the date of first disclosure. During the above stated thirty-day	0	c
period such Proprietary Information shall be protected in accordance with the	0	c
terms of this Agreement. Proprietary Information shall further include any	0	c
information or data that evidence, record, derive from or reveal any Proprietary	0	c
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the components of the System are	0	c
hereby deemed to be Proprietary Information and as such are protected in	0	c
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.	0	s

3. The Receiving Party shall preserve Proprietary Information received	0	c
from the Disclosing Party in confidence by exercising at least the same degree	0	c
of care used to restrict disclosure and use of the Receiving Party's own similar	0	c
confidential information, but at least a reasonable degree of care, and shall	0	c
refrain from disclosing such Propriety Information to its employees not involved	0	c
in the Pilot Study, its consultants, representatives, or agents ( the	0	c
"Affiliates") or to any third party without written authorization from the	0	c
Disclosing Party. This Agreement shall be construed to bind and impose	0	c
obligations upon any other divisions, subsidiaries, business units, and/or	0	c
affiliated companies of the Receiving Party that receive access to the	0	c
Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall	0	c
ensure that all copies of Proprietary Information stored electronically on its	0	c
server, tape backup or on the hard drives of computers used by its Affiliates in	0	c
connection with the Pilot Study have been permanently deleted and Receiving	0	c
Party shall certify such deletion in writing to the Disclosing Party. Receiving	0	c
Party will ensure that all of its Affiliates sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement	0	c
containing confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those set	0	c
forth in this Agreement.	0	s
4. The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the	0	c
Disclosing Party solely for the purposes set forth in Paragraph 1. Any other use	0	c
of the Proprietary Information is explicitly forbidden. This restriction shall	0	c
survive termination of this Agreement.	0	s
5. This Agreement shall not restrict disclosure or use of Proprietary	0	c
Information that is:	0	d
A.    Now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the	0	c
part of Receiving Party, generally known or available; or	0	s
B.    Known by the Receiving Party at the time of receiving such	0	c
information as evidenced by records of the Receiving Party; or	0	s
C.    Hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, as a matter of right and	0	c
without restriction on disclosure, by a third party who had not	0	c
received any Proprietary Information from the Disclosing Party or	0	c
the Receiving Party; or	0	s
D.    is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without	0	c
restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly	0	c
authorized officer of such disclosing party; or	0	s
E.    Independently developed by the Receiving Party by persons who did	0	c
not have access to the Disclosing Party's information and without	0	c
breach of this Agreement.	70	s
6. The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Proprietary	0	c
Information to the extent required to be disclosed pursuant to final court	0	c
order; provided, however, that the Receiving Party: (i) immediately notifies the	0	c
Disclosing Party upon its receipt of any court order or other document that	0	c
requests or demands disclosure of Proprietary Information; and (ii) assert the	0	c
privileged and confidential nature of the Proprietary Information against the	0	c
third party seeking disclosure; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing	0	c
Party in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective	0	c
order narrowing the scope of such disclosure of the Proprietary Information. In	0	c
the event that such protection against disclosure is not obtained, the receiving	0	c
party will be entitled to disclose the Proprietary Information, but only to the	0	c
extent necessary to legally comply with such compelled disclosure and to have	0	c
such required disclosure made under a protective secrecy order.	0	s

immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Proprietary	0	c
Information, and will reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain	0	c
possession of the Proprietary Information and prevent its further unauthorized	0	c
use.	0	s
8. Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the originating	0	c
party. Neither this Agreement nor any exchange of Proprietary Information	0	c
hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any	0	c
copyright, invention, or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by either	0	c
party. Each party shall use and rely upon Proprietary Information received from	0	c
the other at its sole risk and expense.	0	s

in any litigation commenced to enforce or construe the terms of this Agreement	0	c
shall be entitled to collect from the other party the costs of such litigation,	0	c

Study.	0	s
13. The Receiving Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that in the event	0	c
of any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, including, without	0	c
limitation, the actual or threatened disclosure of the Disclosing Party's	0	c
Proprietary Information without the prior express written consent of the	0	c
Disclosing Party, the Disclosing Party will suffer an irreparable injury, such	0	c
that no remedy at law will afford the Disclosing Party with adequate protection	0	c

hereby agrees that the Disclosing Party may be entitled to specific performance	0	c
of the Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement, as well as further	0	c
relief (injunctive or otherwise) as may be granted by a court of competent	0	c
jurisdiction.	0	s
