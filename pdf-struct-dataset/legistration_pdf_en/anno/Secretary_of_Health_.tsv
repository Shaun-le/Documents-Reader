Face Coverings - Statewide	0	x
WHEREAS, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee has issued Proclamation 20-05,	0	c
subsequently amended and extended, proclaiming a statewide State of Emergency due to an	0	c
outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and community spread of	0	c
COVID-19 in Washington State; and	0	s
WHEREAS, COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets	0	c
when infected people, many of whom do not exhibit COVID-19 symptoms, cough, sneeze, or	0	c
talk, and evidence suggests that wearing a cloth face covering reduces an infected person’s	0	c
chance of spreading the infection to others and may protect uninfected persons from larger	0	c
droplets from infected people around them; and	0	s
WHEREAS, the Washington State Department of Health, the United States Centers for Disease	0	c
Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization recommend that people wear	0	c
cloth face coverings when they are gathered with non-household members or in public settings,	0	c
given the substantial number of cases of COVID-19 infection, these precautions must be	0	c
mandatory; and	0	s
WHEREAS, although many Washingtonians wear face coverings voluntarily when in public,	0	c
requiring all Washingtonians to wear cloth face coverings in public, subject to certain	0	c
exceptions, helps control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Washington State; and	0	s
WHEREAS, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and its progression in Washington State	0	c
continue to constitute an emergency threatening the safety of the public health, demanding action	0	c
by the Secretary of Health, and only a small number of Washington’s local health officers have	0	c
issued orders requiring the general public in their jurisdictions to wear cloth face coverings in	0	c
public; and	0	s
WHEREAS, on June 24, 2020, Order of the Secretary of Health 20-03 was issued, directing	0	c
every person in Washington State to wear a face covering when in any indoor or outdoor public	0	c
setting, subject to certain exceptions; and	0	s
WHEREAS, on July 24, 2020, Order of the Secretary of Health 20-03.1 was issued, directing	0	c
every person in Washington State to wear a face covering when outside of their dwelling unit,	0	c
subject to certain exception; and	0	s
Page 1	0	e
WHEREAS, for the same reasons stated above, requiring people to wear face coverings when in	0	c
a place where non-household members are present or generally accessible to non-household	0	c
members will help control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Washington State; and	0	s
WHEREAS, it is scientifically appropriate to amend the face covering order to incorporate new	0	c
CDC guidance recommending that fully vaccinated people need not wear face coverings, except	0	c
in certain limited settings.	0	s
NOW, THEREFORE, I, Umair A. Shah, MD, MPH, Washington State Secretary of Health, as	0	c
a result of the above-noted situation, and under RCW 43.70.130, RCW 70.05.070, WAC 246-	0	c

order as follows:	0	d

exceptions below and any face covering requirements and limitations on gatherings and	0	c
activities imposed by the Governor or other legal authority.	0	d

outside their household;	0	s

People Exempt from General Face Covering Requirement	0	d
The following people are exempt from the requirement to wear a face covering:	0	d
•  People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, except when in health care settings,	0	c
correctional facilities, homeless shelters, or schools;	0	s
•  Children younger than five years old; and	0	d
o  Children who are younger than two years old should never wear face coverings due to the	0	c
risk of suffocation.	0	s
o  Children who are two, three, or four years old, with the assistance and close supervision	0	c
of an adult, are strongly recommended to wear a face covering at all times in settings, like	0	c
grocery stores or pharmacies, where it is likely that a distance of at least six feet cannot	0	c
be maintained from non-household members and vulnerable people must go.	94	s
•  People with a medical condition, mental health condition, developmental or cognitive	0	c
condition, or disability that prevents wearing a face covering. This includes, but is not limited	0	c
to, people with a medical condition for whom wearing a face covering could obstruct	0	c
breathing or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a face	0	c
covering without assistance.	90	s
Additional Provisions	0	d
•  Types of face coverings permitted	0	d
o  For purposes of this order, a face covering must:	0	d
  Fit snugly against the sides of the face;	0	s
  Completely cover the nose and mouth;	0	s
  Be secured with ties, ear loops, elastic bands, or other equally effective method; and	0	s
Include at least one layer of tightly woven fabric without visible holes, although	0	c
multiple layers are strongly recommended.	108	s
o  A face covering may also be a mask or face covering that provides a higher level of	0	c
protection than a cloth face covering, such as a medical procedure/surgical mask, a KN95	0	c
mask, or an N95 mask.	0	s
o  Clear masks or cloth masks with a clear plastic panel may be used when interacting with	0	c
people who are deaf or hard of hearing, young children or students learning to read,	0	c
students learning a new language, people with disabilities, and people who need to see	0	c
the proper shape of the mouth for making appropriate vowel sounds.	0	s
o  Children and staff in childcare facilities and K-12 public and private schools may use	0	c
face shields with drapes or wraps as an alternative to cloth face coverings if authorized	0	c
pursuant to an order of the Governor.	107	s
Page 3	0	e
•  A person is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 two weeks after they have received the	0	c
second dose in a two-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) or two weeks after they	0	c
have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen).	0	s
•  A person is at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 if they have any of the	0	c
medical conditions identified by the CDC as making a person more likely to get severely ill	0	c
from COVID-19. These conditions are currently listed on the following CDC website:	0	c
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-	0	c
conditions.html.	0	s
•  This order does not apply to persons who are incarcerated. Correctional facilities have	0	c
specific guidance on the wearing of face coverings or masks for both incarcerated individuals	0	c
and staff.	0	s
•  Face covering requirements imposed by other public agencies or officials	0	d
o  Face covering requirements lawfully imposed by another public agency or official are to	0	c
be followed if they are more protective than the requirements in this order. If they are less	0	c
protective, then this order must be followed.	0	d
  For example, this order allows fully vaccinated individuals to not wear face	0	c
coverings, except when in health care settings, correctional facilities, homeless	0	c
shelters, or schools. If a local health officer issues an order requiring people to wear	0	c
face coverings in other settings not listed, then the local health officer’s order must be	0	c
followed.	139	s
o  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any face covering requirements imposed pursuant to an	0	c
order of the Governor take precedence over this order.	-1	s
This order shall take effect on May 15, 2021, and remain in effect until rescinded or superseded	0	c
by a subsequent order of the Secretary of Health or until the Governor issues a proclamation	0	c
declaring the termination of the State of Emergency declared by Proclamation 20-05, as amended	0	c
and extended by subsequent amendatory proclamations, whichever is earlier.	0	s
Members of the public are required by law to comply with this order, and violators may be	0	c
subject to enforcement action pursuant to RCW 43.70.130(7), RCW 70.05.120(4), and WAC	0	c
246-100-070(3).	0	s
