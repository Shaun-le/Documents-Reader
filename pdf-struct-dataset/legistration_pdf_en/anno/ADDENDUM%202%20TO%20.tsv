NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of	0	c
Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 20 and under 20 V.S.A.	0	c
§§ 8, 9 and 11, hereby order the amendment of the Amended and Restated Executive Order  as	0	c

Section  7(f)  of  the  Amended  and  Restated  Executive  Order  regarding  Mask  Use  is  hereby	0	c
amended in its entirety to read as follows:	0	d
(f) Masks or Cloth Facial Coverings Required in Public Wherever Close Contact is Unavoidable.	0	c
As of Saturday, August 1, 2020, Vermonters shall wear masks or cloth facial coverings over their	0	c
nose and mouth any time they are in public spaces, indoors or outdoors, where they come in contact	0	c
with others from outside their households, especially in congregate settings, and where it is not	0	c
possible to maintain a physical distance of at least six feet.	0	s
Nothing in this Order or any other State health and safety guidance shall require the use of a mask	0	c
or cloth facial covering when someone is engaged in strenuous  exercise or activity, for anyone	0	c
under the age of 2, any child or adult with a medical or developmental issue or challenge that is	0	c
complicated or irritated by a facial covering, anyone with difficulty breathing or as further set forth	0	c
in guidance issued by VDH.	0	s
A  person  who  declines  to  wear  a  mask  or  cloth  face  covering  because  of  a  medical  or	0	c
developmental issue, or difficulty breathing, shall not be required to produce documentation, or	0	c
other evidence, verifying the condition.	0	s
Businesses and non-profit and government entities shall implement measures notifying customers	0	c
or clients of the requirement to wear masks or facial coverings, which may include, but shall not	0	c
be limited to, posting signage stating that masks or cloth facial coverings are required and denial	0	c
