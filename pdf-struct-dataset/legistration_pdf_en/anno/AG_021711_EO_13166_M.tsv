MEMORANDUM FOR:    HEADS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES , GENERAL COUNSELS,	0	x
AND CIVIL RIGHTS HEADS	0	x
FROM:	0	x
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL C'  . ..>l '〜7〜	0	x
SUBJECT:                     Federal Government 's Renewed Commitment to Language  Access	0	x
Obligations Under Executive Order  13166	0	x
Executi ve  Order  13 166 1 was issued in  August of2000 and this memorandum reaffirms	0	c
its mandate.  The Executive Order has two primary pat1S.  First, it  directs each  federal  agency to	0	c
develop and implement a system by which  limited English profi cient (LEP)  persons can	0	c
meaningfull y access the agency 's services.  Second, it directs each agency providing federal	0	c
financial  assistance to  issue guidance to  recipients of such  assistance on  their legal  obligations to	0	c
take reasonable steps to  ensure meaningful access for LEP persons under the national orig in	0	c
nondi scrimination  provisions of Title VI  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and  implementing	0	c
regulations.	0	s
Whether in  an  emergency or in  the course of routine business matters,  the success of	0	c
government eff0l1s to effectively communicate with  members of the public depends on  the	0	c
widespread and nondi scriminatOlY availability of accurate, timely,  and vital  information.  Events	0	c
such as the HI N I  influenza  pandemic, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , the Gul fo il  spill, and the	0	c
20 I 0  Decennial Census highli ght  the  need for  federal  agencies to ensure language access both  in	0	c
their own acti vities, as  well  as  in  those of the recipients of federal  fin ancial  assistance.	0	c
Despite the lega l and public service obligations that compel  federal  agencies and	0	c
recipients to ensure language access, a 2006 language access survey of the  federal  government	0	c
revealed significant variations in the extent to which  federal  agencies are aware of, and in	0	c
compliance with , principles of language access.  This conclusion  is buttressed by an  April  20 I 0	0	c
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on  language access at  federal  agencies.  That	0	c
report offers concrete suggestions,  some of which are incorporated in  thi s memorandum , for	0	c
improving our efforts to  comply with  Executive Order 13 166.  Further, federal interagency	0	c
language access conferences held over the  last few years reveal that, while the  federal	0	c
government as  a whol e has taken commendable strides toward  providing language access in	0	c
I  65  Fed. Reg.  50, 121  (A ug.  16, 2000).	0	x
Memorandum  fro m the Attorney General                                                          Page 2	0	e

certain  areas, the implementation of comprehensive  language access programs remains uneven	0	c

In an  effort  to sec ure the federal  government 's fu ll  compli ance with Executi ve Order	0	c
