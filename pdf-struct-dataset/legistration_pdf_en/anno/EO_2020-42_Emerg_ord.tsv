The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that can result in serious illness	0	c
or death. It is caused by a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans	0	c
and easily spread from person to person. There is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral	0	c
treatment for this disease.	0	s
On March 10, 2020, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services identified the	0	c
first two presumptive-positive cases of COVID-19 in Michigan. On that same day, I issued	0	c
Executive Order 2020-4. This order declared a state of emergency across the state of	0	c
Michigan under section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, the Emergency	0	c
Management Act, 1976 PA 390, as amended, MCL 30.401 et seq., and the Emergency	0	c
Powers of the Governor Act of 1945, 1945 PA 302, as amended, MCL 10.31 et seq.	0	s
In the three weeks that followed, the virus spread across Michigan, bringing deaths in the	0	c
hundreds, confirmed cases in the thousands, and deep disruption to this state’s economy,	0	c
homes, and educational, civic, social, and religious institutions. On April 1, 2020, in	0	c
response to the widespread and severe health, economic, and social harms posed by the	0	c
COVID-19 pandemic, I issued Executive Order 2020-33. This order expanded on Executive	0	c
Order 2020-4 and declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster across the	0	c
State of Michigan under section 1 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, the	0	c
Emergency Management Act, and the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945.	0	s
The Emergency Management Act vests the governor with broad powers and duties to	0	c
“cop[e] with dangers to this state or the people of this state presented by a disaster or	0	c
emergency,” which the governor may implement through “executive orders, proclamations,	0	c
and directives having the force and effect of law.” MCL 30.403(1)-(2). Similarly, the	0	c
Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945 provides that, after declaring a state of	0	c
emergency, “the governor may promulgate reasonable orders, rules, and regulations as he	0	c
or she considers necessary to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation	0	c
within the affected area under control.” MCL 10.31(1).	0	s

To suppress the spread of COVID-19, to prevent the state’s health care system from being	0	c
overwhelmed, to allow time for the production of critical test kits, ventilators, and personal	0	c
protective equipment, and to avoid needless deaths, it is reasonable and necessary to direct	0	c
residents to remain at home or in their place of residence to the maximum extent feasible.	0	c
To that end, on March 23, 2020, I issued Executive Order 2020-21, ordering all people in	0	c
Michigan to stay home and stay safe. The order limited gatherings and travel, and required	0	c
workers who are not necessary to sustain or protect life to stay home.	0	s
The measures put in place by Executive Order 2020-21 have been effective, but this virus is	0	c
both aggressive and persistent: on April 8, 2020, Michigan reported 20,346 confirmed cases	0	c
of COVID-19 and 959 deaths from it. To win this fight, and to protect the health and safety	0	c
of our state and each other, we must be just as aggressive and persistent. Though we have	0	c
all made sacrifices, we must be steadfast. Accordingly, with this order, I find it reasonable	0	c
and necessary to reaffirm the measures set forth in Executive Order 2020-21, clarify them,	0	c
and extend their duration to April 30, 2020. This order takes effect on April 9, 2020 at 11:59	0	c
pm. When this order takes effect, Executive Order 2020-21 is rescinded.	0	s
Acting under the Michigan Constitution of 1963 and Michigan law, I order the following:	0	d
1.     This order must be construed broadly to prohibit in-person work that is not	0	c
necessary to sustain or protect life.	0	s
2.     Subject to the exceptions in section 7 of this order, all individuals currently living	0	c
within the State of Michigan are ordered to stay at home or at their place of	0	c
residence. Subject to the same exceptions, all public and private gatherings of any	0	c
number of people occurring among persons not part of a single household are	0	c
prohibited.	0	s
3.     All individuals who leave their home or place of residence must adhere to social	0	c
distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and	0	c
Prevention (“CDC”), including remaining at least six feet from people from outside	0	c
the individual’s household to the extent feasible under the circumstances.	0	s
4.     No person or entity shall operate a business or conduct operations that require	0	c
workers to leave their homes or places of residence except to the extent that those	0	c
workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic	0	c
operations.	0	d
(a)    For purposes of this order, workers who are necessary to sustain or protect	0	c
life are defined as “critical infrastructure workers,” as described in sections 8	0	c
and 9 of this order.	0	s
(b)    For purposes of this order, workers who are necessary to conduct minimum	0	c
basic operations are those whose in-person presence is strictly necessary to	0	c
allow the business or operation to maintain the value of inventory and	0	c
equipment, care for animals, ensure security, process transactions (including	0	c
payroll and employee benefits), or facilitate the ability of other workers to	0	c
work remotely.	0	b
2	0	e
Businesses and operations must determine which of their workers are	0	c
necessary to conduct minimum basic operations and inform such workers of	0	c
that designation. Businesses and operations must make such designations in	0	c
writing, whether by electronic message, public website, or other appropriate	0	c
means. Workers need not carry copies of their designations when they leave	0	c
the home or place of residence for work.	0	b
Any in-person work necessary to conduct minimum basic operations must be	0	c
performed consistently with the social distancing practices and other	0	c
mitigation measures described in section 10 of this order.	65	s
5.     Businesses and operations that employ critical infrastructure workers may continue	0	c
in-person operations, subject to the following conditions:	0	d
(a)    Consistent with sections 8 and 9 of this order, businesses and operations	0	c
must determine which of their workers are critical infrastructure workers	0	c

patrons, as described in section 10 of this order. Stores that are open to the	0	c
public must also adhere to the rules described in section 11 of this order.	86	s
6.     All in-person government activities at whatever level (state, county, or local) that	0	c
are not necessary to sustain or protect life, or to support those businesses and	0	c
operations that are necessary to sustain or protect life, are suspended.	0	d
(a)    For purposes of this order, necessary government activities include activities	0	c
performed by critical infrastructure workers, including workers in law	0	c

alternatives to lines, including by allowing customers to wait in their cars for	0	c
a text message or phone call, to enable social distancing and to accommodate	0	c
seniors and those with disabilities.	0	s
8	0	e
(b)    Consider establishing curbside pick-up to reduce in-store traffic and mitigate	0	c
outdoor lines.	0	s
(c)     For stores of less than 50,000 square feet of customer floor space, limit the	0	c

(4)    Create at least two hours per week of dedicated shopping time for	0	c
vulnerable populations, which for purposes of this order are people	0	c

(e)     The director of the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized	0	c

15.    This order takes effect on April 9, 2020 at 11:59 pm and continues through April 30,	0	c
2020 at 11:59 pm. When this order takes effect, Executive Order 2020-21 is	0	c
rescinded. All references to that order in other executive orders, agency rules, letters	0	c
of understanding, or other legal authorities shall be taken to refer to this order.	0	s
16.    I will evaluate the continuing need for this order prior to its expiration. In	0	c
determining whether to maintain, intensify, or relax its restrictions, I will consider,	0	c
among other things, (1) data on COVID-19 infections and the disease’s rate of	0	c
spread; (2) whether sufficient medical personnel, hospital beds, and ventilators exist	0	c
to meet anticipated medical need; (3) the availability of personal protective	0	c
equipment for the health-care workforce; (4) the state’s capacity to test for COVID-	0	c
19 cases and isolate infected people; and (5) economic conditions in the state.	0	s
17.    Consistent with MCL 10.33 and MCL 30.405(3), a willful violation of this order is a	0	c
misdemeanor.	-1	s
