EXECUTIVE ORDER #94	0	x
Relating to Actions Every Wisconsinite Should Take to Protect their	0	x
Family, Friends, and Neighbors from COVID-19	0	x
WHEREAS,  the  State  of  Wisconsin  is  in  the  middle  of  a  deadly,	0	c
uncontrolled,  and  drastically  growing  spike  in  cases  of  COVID-19.  Without	0	c
intervening measures,  the State will  continue to  be  the nation's COVID-19  hot	0	c
spot;	0	s
WHEREAS, without a  vaccine, the only tools to slow the spread of COVID-	0	c
19  is to  physically distance and wear a  mask. Without using these  simple but	0	c
vital life-saving tools, Wisconsin will continue to suffer from unnecessary illness	0	c
and death;	0	s
WHEREAS,  it took seven months for Wisconsin to reach its first  100,000	0	c
COVID-19 cases, but only five  weeks to reach the second 100,000 cases. At the	0	c
current rate of growth, we will reach the third 100,000 cases in only twenty days.	0	c
Wisconsin consistently has more new cases of COVID-19 per day than the entire	0	c
country of Canada has each day;	0	s
WHEREAS,  as of November 9,  2020,  2,329 Wisconsinites lost their lives	0	c
due to  COVID-19.  The University  of Washington's  Institute  for  Health  Metrics	0	c
and  Evaluation  projects  that,  based  on  current  data,  approximately  5,000	0	c
Wisconsinites could die from COVID-19 by January 1, 2021, if no further actions	0	c
are taken to slow the spread of COVID-19.  By contrast, universal mask wearing	0	c
could save almost 800 lives by January 1;	0	s
WHEREAS,  as  the  number  of cases  continue  to  increase,  so  does  the	0	c
number of people  who  die  every  day.  COVID-19  is  already one  of the  leading	0	c
causes of death in Wisconsin for 2020. On average, more Wisconsinites are dying	0	c
every day from COVID-19 than the average number of people who die per month	0	c
in car accidents in the state;	0	s
WHEREAS, the consequences of failing to act will continue to be	0	c
devastating and deadly. Hospital capacity shortages throughout the state are at	0	c
record high levels; and	0	s
WHEREAS, despite these efforts, only the people of Wisconsin can do	0	c
what it takes to slow the spread of this disease and decrease the number of	0	c
people suffering and dying every day. Every Wisconsinite must take individual	0	c
responsibility to wear a  face covering,  stay home as much as possible,	0	c
physically distance at least six feet from others, wash hands frequently, and	0	c
keep your social circle to five  people or less.	0	s
