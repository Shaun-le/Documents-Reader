ORDER OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE	0	x
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA	0	x
On 13 March 2020, I issued an order with two emergency directives affecting	0	c
the North Carolina Judicial Branch in response to the emerging public health threat	0	c
posed  by  the  COVID-19  outbreak.  On  19  March  2020,  I  issued  another  order	0	c
extending time and periods of limitation for documents and papers due to be filed and	0	c
acts due to be done in the trial courts.	0	s
On 27 March 2020, Governor Roy Cooper issued Executive Order 121 directing	0	c
all  individuals  in  the  state  to  stay  in  their  place  of  residence  subject  to  limited	0	c
exceptions.  North  Carolina’s  courts  are  a  critical  government  function  and  are	0	c
therefore  exempt  from  the  order.  Nevertheless,  we  are  directed,  to  the  extent	0	c
practicable, to maintain social distancing requirements, including “facilitating online	0	c
or remote access by customers if possible.”	0	s
Additional  emergency  directives  under  N.C.G.S.  §  7A-39(b)(2)  are  now	0	c
necessary to reduce the spread of infection and to ensure the continuing operation of	0	c
essential court functions.	0	s
Accordingly, I hereby determine and declare under N.C.G.S. § 7A-39(b)(2) that	0	c
catastrophic  conditions  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  outbreak  have  existed  and	0	c
continue to exist in all counties of this state.	0	s
Emergency Directive 1	0	d
All superior court and district court proceedings, including proceedings before	0	c
the clerks of superior court, must be scheduled or rescheduled for a date no sooner	0	c
than 1 June 2020, unless:	0	d
a.  the proceeding will be conducted remotely;	0	s
b.  the  proceeding  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  right  to  due  process  of  law	0	c
(e.g., a first appearance or bond hearing, the appointment of counsel for an	0	c
indigent defendant, a probation hearing, a probable cause hearing, etc.);	0	s
c.  the  proceeding  is  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  emergency  relief  (e.g., a	0	c
domestic  violence  protection  order,  temporary  restraining  order,  juvenile	0	c
custody  order,  judicial  consent  to  juvenile  medical  treatment  order,  civil	0	c
commitment order, etc.); or	0	s
d.  the senior resident superior court judge, chief business court judge, or chief	0	c
district court judge determines that the proceeding can be conducted under	0	c
conditions that protect the health and safety of all participants.	23	s
The examples provided above are not exhaustive.	0	s
1	0	e
This emergency directive does not apply to any proceeding in which a jury has	0	c
already been empaneled.	20	s
Emergency Directive 2	0	d
The clerks of superior court shall post a notice at the entrance to every court	0	c
facility  in  their  county  directing  that  any  person  who  has  likely  been  exposed  to	0	c
COVID-19 should not enter the courthouse. A person who has likely been exposed to	0	c
COVID-19 and who has business before the courts shall contact the clerk of superior	0	c
court’s  office  by  telephone  or  other  remote  means,  inform  court  personnel  of  the	0	c
nature  of his or  her  business before  the  court,  and  receive  further  instruction.  For	0	c
purposes of this order, a person who has likely been exposed to COVID-19 is defined	0	c
as any person who:	0	d
a.  has travelled internationally within the preceding 14 days;	0	s
b.  is experiencing fever, cough, or shortness of breath;	0	s
c.  has been directed to quarantine, isolate, or self-monitor;	0	s
d.  has a known exposure to COVID-19;	0	s
e.  has been diagnosed with COVID-19; or	0	s
f.  resides  with  or  has  been  in  close  contact  with  any  person  in  the	0	c
abovementioned categories.	39	s
Emergency Directive 3	0	d
Judicial  officials  throughout  the  state  are  hereby  authorized  to  conduct	0	c
proceedings  by  remote  audio  and  video  transmissions,  notwithstanding  any  other	0	c
North Carolina statutory or regulatory provision.	0	s
Judicial officials who conduct a remote proceeding pursuant to this directive	0	c
must safeguard the constitutional rights of those persons involved in the proceeding	0	c
and preserve the integrity of the judicial process. To this end:	0	d
a.  A  remote  proceeding  may  not  be  conducted  without  the  consent  of  each	0	c
party.	0	s
b.  If  a  criminal  defendant’s  right  to  confront  witnesses  or  to  be  present  is	0	c
implicated  by  the  proceeding  that  is to  be conducted,  then the  defendant	0	c
must  waive  any  right  to  in-person  confrontation  or  presence  before  that	0	c
proceeding may be conducted remotely.	0	s
c.  If the proceeding is required by law to be conducted in a way that maintains	0	c
confidentiality,  then  confidentiality  must  be  maintained  in  the  remote	0	c
proceeding.	0	s
2	0	e
d.  If  the  proceeding  is  required  by  law  to  be  recorded,  then  the  remote	0	c
proceeding must be recorded.	0	s
e.  Each party to a remote proceeding must be able to communicate fully and	0	c
confidentially  with  his  or  her  attorney  if  the  party  is  represented  by  an	0	c
attorney.	61	s
The authorization in this emergency directive does not extend to proceedings	0	c
that involve a jury.	0	s
Nothing in this emergency directive prevents judicial officials from conducting	0	c
in-person proceedings consistent with Emergency Directive 1.	55	s
Emergency Directive 4	0	d
Attorneys and other persons who do not have business in a courthouse should	0	c
not enter a courthouse, and those who do have business in a courthouse should not	0	c
prolong  their  visit  once  their  business  has  concluded.  Attorneys  are  strongly	0	c
encouraged to submit filings by mail rather than in person.	81	s
Emergency Directive 5	0	d
When it is required that any pleading, motion, petition, supporting affidavit,	0	c
or other document of any kind to be filed in the General Court of Justice be verified,	0	c
or that an oath be taken, it shall be sufficient if the subscriber affirms the truth of	0	c
the  matter  to  be  verified  by  an  affirmation  or  representation  in  substantially  the	0	c
following language:	0	d
“I  (we)  affirm,  under  the  penalties  for  perjury,  that  the  foregoing	0	c
representation(s) is (are) true.	0	a
(Signed) ___________________”	91	s

real estate, or any document that is not to be filed in the General Court of Justice.	86	s
Emergency Directive 6	0	d
Notwithstanding the manner of service described in Rule 5 of the Rules of Civil	0	c
Procedure,  service  required  by  Rule  5  may  be  made  electronically  on  a  party  or  a	0	c
party’s attorney as follows:	0	d
If  the  party  has  consented  in  writing  to  service  by  electronic  mail  (“email”),	0	c
then service may be made on the party by email to an address that is either included	0	c
in the consent or is otherwise on record with the court in the case. The email must be	0	c
timestamped  before  5:00  P.M.  Eastern  Time  on  a  regular  business  day  to  be	0	c
3	0	e
considered  served  on  that  day.  If  the  email  is  timestamped  after  5:00  P.M.,  then	0	c
service will be deemed to have been completed on the next business day.	0	s
If the attorney has consented in writing to service by email, then service may	0	c
also be made on the attorney by email to an address  that is either included in the	0	c
consent  or  is  otherwise  on  record  with  the  court  in  the  case.  The  email  must  be	0	c
timestamped  before  5:00  P.M.  Eastern  Time  on  a  regular  business  day  to  be	0	c
considered  served  on  that  day.  If  the  email  is  timestamped  after  5:00  P.M.,  then	0	c
service will be deemed to have been completed on the next business day.	0	s
If one or more persons are served by email, then the certificate of service shall	0	c
show the email address of each person so served.	100	s
Nothing in this emergency directive is intended to modify electronic service in	0	c
the  North  Carolina  Business  Court,  which  continues  to  be  governed  by  Business	0	c
Court Rule 3.	97	s
Emergency Directive 7	0	d
For all monies owed pursuant to a judgment or order entered by a court prior	0	c
to 6 April 2020 in a criminal or infraction case with a payment due date on or after	0	c
6 April 2020 and before or on 1 May 2020, the date by which payment must be made	0	c
is hereby extended 90 days. Nonpayment of monetary obligations in such cases shall	0	c
not be deemed a willful failure to comply, and the clerks of superior court are directed	0	c
not to enter or report a failure to comply as a result of nonpayment during the 90-day	0	c
extension period.	0	s
The clerks of superior court also are directed not to enter or report, until after	0	c
the expiration of this order, a failure to comply for a criminal or infraction case with	0	c
a payment due date before 6 April 2020 where the 40th day following nonpayment	0	c
falls on or after 6 April 2020 and before or on 1 May 2020.	0	s
If a court enters a judgment or order on or after 6 April 2020 and before or on	0	c
1 May 2020 in a criminal or infraction case, then the payment due date must be at	0	c
least 90 days after the date of entry of the judgment or order, and the installment fee	0	c
of N.C.G.S. § 7A-304(f) shall not be assessed until after the due date has passed.	0	s
Monetary obligations owed pursuant to a term of probation which is scheduled	0	c
to end within 30 days after the date that this order is issued are excluded from the	0	c
operation of this emergency directive.	-1	s

Expiration of this Emergency Order and	0	c
Guidance to Judicial System Stakeholders	0	d
Pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 7A-39(b)(2), the emergency directives contained in this	0	c
order are effective immediately and expire on 1 May 2020.	0	s
Nevertheless,  given  the  current  severity  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  I  fully	0	c
expect to extend these directives for an additional 30-day period. Accordingly, judicial	0	c
system stakeholders should plan for these directives to last through the month of May	0	c
2020.	0	s
These  emergency  directives  are  crucial  to  ensuring  that  our  court  system	0	c
continues  to  administer  justice  while  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  court	0	c
officials, court personnel, and the public.	0	s
I encourage all court officials to liberally grant additional accommodations to	0	c
parties,  witnesses,  attorneys,  and  others  with  business  before  the  courts,  as  they	0	c
deem appropriate.	-1	s
