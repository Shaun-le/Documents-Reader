ORDER UNDER SECTION 6(c) AND SECTION 38(a) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY	0	x
ACT OF 1940 GRANTING EXEMPTIONS FROM SPECIFIED PROVISIONS OF THE	0	x
INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND CERTAIN RULES THEREUNDER; COMMISSION	0	x
STATEMENT REGARDING PROSPECTUS DELIVERY	0	x
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported on	0	c
December 31, 2019.  The disease has led to disruptions to transportation, including buses,	0	c
subways, trains and airplanes, and the imposition of quarantines around the world.  The	0	c
Commission has heard from industry representatives that COVID-19 may present challenges for	0	c
boards of directors of registered management investment companies and business development	0	c
companies (“BDCs”) to travel in order to meet the in-person voting requirements under the	0	c
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act” or “the Act”) and rules	0	c
thereunder.  In addition, we recognize that registered management investment companies and	0	c
unit investment trusts (together, “registered funds”) may face challenges if, as a result of	0	c
COVID-19, personnel of registered fund managers or other third-party service providers that are	0	c
necessary to prepare these reports become unavailable, or only available on a limited basis, in: (i)	0	c
preparing or transmitting annual and semi-annual shareholder reports; and/or (ii) timely filing	0	c
Forms N-CEN and N-PORT.  We also understand that due to recent market movements certain	0	c
registered closed-end funds (“closed-end funds”) and BDCs may seek to call or redeem	0	c
securities and may face challenges in providing the advance notice required under Rule 23c-2.	0	c
Finally, we appreciate that there may be difficulties in the timely delivery of registered fund	0	c
prospectuses.  In light of the current situation, we are issuing this Order providing an exemption	0	c
from certain requirements of the Investment Company Act and a statement regarding prospectus	0	c
delivery obligations of registered funds.	0	s
Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act provides that the Commission may	0	c
conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or	0	c
classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Investment	0	c
Company Act, or any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is	0	c
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and	0	c
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Investment Company Act.	0	c
Section 38(a) of the Investment Company Act provides that the Commission may make, issue,	0	c
amend and rescind such rules and regulations and such orders as are necessary or appropriate to	0	c
the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Commission under the Investment Company Act.	0	s
I.      TIME PERIOD FOR THE EXEMPTIVE RELIEF	0	d
The time period for the relief specified in this Order is as follows:	0	d
•  For the relief in Sections II and V of this Order, the relief is limited to the period from	0	c
and including the date of this Order to June 15, 2020.	0	s
•  For the relief in Sections III and IV of this Order, the relief is limited to filing or	0	c
transmittal obligations, as applicable, for which the original due date is on or after the	0	c
date of this Order but on or prior to April 30, 2020.	37	s
The Commission intends to continue to monitor the current situation.  The time period for	0	c
any or all of the relief may, if necessary, be extended with any additional conditions that are	0	c
deemed appropriate, and the Commission may issue other relief as necessary or appropriate.	36	s
II.     IN-PERSON BOARD MEETING REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTERED	0	c
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND BDCs	0	d
In light of the current and potential effects of COVID-19, the Commission finds that the	0	c
exemptions set forth below:	0	d
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the	0	c
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and	0	c
provisions of the Investment Company Act; and	0	s
are necessary and appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the	0	c
Investment Company Act.	49	s
The necessity for prompt action of the Commission does not permit prior notice of the	0	c
Commission’s action.	0	s
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 38(a) of the Act:	0	d
That for the period specified in Section I, a registered management investment company or BDC	0	c
and any investment adviser of or principal underwriter for such registered management	0	c
investment company or BDC is exempt from the requirements imposed under sections 15(c) and	0	c
32(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 12b-1(b)(2) and 15a-4(b)(2)(ii) under the	0	c
Investment Company Act that votes of the board of directors of either the registered management	0	c
investment company or BDC be cast in person, provided that:	0	d
(i) reliance on this Order is necessary or appropriate due to circumstances related to	0	c
current or potential effects of COVID-19;	0	s
(ii) the votes required to be cast at an in-person meeting are instead cast at a meeting in	0	c
which directors may participate by any means of communication that allows all directors	0	c
participating to hear each other simultaneously during the meeting; and	0	s
(iii) the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested	0	c
persons of the registered management investment company or BDC, ratifies the action	0	c
taken pursuant to this exemption by vote cast at the next in-person meeting.	47	s
III.   FORMS N-CEN AND N-PORT FILING REQUIREMENTS	0	d
Disruptions to transportation, and limited access to facilities, personnel, and third party	0	c
service providers as a result of COVID-19 could hamper the efforts of registered funds with	0	c
filing obligations to meet their filing deadlines.  At the same time, investors and the Commission	0	c
have an interest in the timely availability of required information about their investments, and we	0	c
remind registered funds who are relying on this Order to continue to evaluate their obligations to	0	c
make materially accurate and complete disclosures in accordance with the federal securities	0	c
laws.	0	s
In light of the current and potential effects of COVID-19, the Commission finds that the	0	c
exemptions set forth below:	0	d
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the	0	c
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and	0	c
provisions of the Investment Company Act; and	0	s
are necessary and appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the	0	c
Investment Company Act.	81	s
The necessity for prompt action of the Commission does not permit prior notice of the	0	c
Commission’s action.	0	s
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, pursuant to Section 6(c) and 38(a) of the Investment Company	0	c
Act:	0	d
That for the period specified in Section I, a registered fund that is required to file Form N-CEN	0	c
pursuant to Rule 30a-1 under the Investment Company Act, or Form N-PORT pursuant to Rule	0	c
30b1-9 under the Investment Company Act, is temporarily exempt from such form filing	0	c
requirements where the conditions below are satisfied.	0	c
Conditions.	0	d
(a)  The registered fund is unable to meet a filing deadline due to circumstances related to	0	c
current or potential effects of COVID-19;	0	s
(b) Any registered fund relying on this Order promptly notifies the Commission staff via	0	c
email at IM-EmergencyRelief@sec.gov stating:	0	d
(1) that it is relying on this Order;	0	s
(2) a brief description of the reasons why it could not file its report on a timely basis;	0	c
and	0	s
(3) the estimated date by which it expects to file the report.	99	s
(c)    Any registered fund relying on this Order includes a statement on the applicable	0	c
registered fund’s public website briefly stating that it is relying on this Order and the	0	c
reasons why it could not file its reports on a timely basis;	0	s
(d) The registered fund required to file such Form N-CEN or Form N-PORT files such report	0	c
as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the original due date; and	0	s
(e)  Any Form N-CEN or Form N-PORT filed pursuant to this Order must include a	0	c
statement of the filer that it relied on this Order and the reasons why it was unable to file	0	c
such report on a timely basis.	72	s
IV.    TRANSMITTAL OF ANNUAL AND SEMI-ANNUAL REPORTS TO	0	c
INVESTORS REQUIRED BY THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND THE	0	c
RULES THEREUNDER	0	d
For the reasons cited in Section III above, we believe that relief is warranted for the	0	c
preparation or transmittal by registered funds of annual and semi-annual reports to investors.  In	0	c
light of the current and potential effects of COVID-19, the Commission finds that the	0	c
exemptions set forth below:	0	d
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the	0	c
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and	0	c
provisions of the Investment Company Act; and	0	s
are necessary and appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the	0	c
Act.	118	s
The necessity for prompt action of the Commission does not permit prior notice of the	0	c
Commission’s action.	0	s
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 38(a) of the Investment Company	0	c
Act:	0	d
That for the period specified in Section I, a registered management investment company is	0	c
temporarily exempt from the requirements of Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act and	0	c

For the period specified in Section I, a registered unit investment trust is temporarily exempt	0	c

V.     TIMING OF FILING FORM N-23C-2 WITH THE COMMISSION REQUIRED	0	c
BY THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND THE RULES THEREUNDER	0	d
For the reasons cited in Section III above, we believe that relief is warranted for closed-	0	c
end funds and BDCs with respect to the 30-day notice requirement in Rule 23c-2(b) under the	0	c
Investment Company Act.  In light of the current and potential effects of COVID-19, the	0	c
Commission finds that the exemptions set forth below:	0	d
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the	0	c
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and	0	c
provisions of the Act; and	0	s
are necessary and appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the	0	c
Act.	156	s
The necessity for prompt action of the Commission does not permit prior notice of the	0	c
Commission’s action.	0	s
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, pursuant to Section 6(c) and 38(a) of the Investment Company	0	c
Act:	0	d
That for the period specified in Section I, closed-end funds and BDCs are temporarily exempt	0	c
from the requirement to file with the Commission notices of their intention to call or redeem	0	c
securities at least 30 days in advance under Sections 23(c) and 63, as applicable, of the	0	c
Investment Company Act and Rule 23c-2 thereunder if such company files a Form N-23C-2	0	c
(“Notice”) with the Commission fewer than 30 days prior to, including the same business day as,	0	c
the company’s call or redemption of securities of which it is the issuer where the conditions	0	c
below are satisfied:	0	d
Conditions:	0	d

c.  providing notification to the existing shareholders whose securities are	0	c
being called or redeemed.	152	s
VI.  COMMISSION STATEMENT REGARDING PROSPECTUS DELIVERY	0	d
For the reasons cited in Section III above, the Commission takes the position that it would not	0	c
provide a basis for a Commission enforcement action if a registered fund does not deliver to	0	c
investors the current prospectus of the registered fund where the prospectus is not able to be	0	c
timely delivered because of circumstances related to COVID-19 and delivery was due during the	0	c
limited period specified below, provided that the sale of shares to the investor was not an initial	0	c
purchase by the investor of shares of the registered fund and:	0	d

EmergencyRelief@sec.gov stating: (1) that it is relying on this Commission position; (2)	0	c
a brief description of the reasons why it or any other person required could not deliver the	0	c
prospectus to investors on a timely basis; and (3) the estimated date by which it expects	0	c
the prospectus to be delivered;	0	s
(b)   Publishes on its public website that it intends to rely on the Commission position and	0	c
briefly states the reasons why it could not deliver the prospectus on a timely basis;	0	s
(c)   Publishes its current prospectus on its public website; and	195	s
