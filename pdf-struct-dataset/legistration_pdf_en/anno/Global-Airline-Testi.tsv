SUMMARY:	0	d
Pursuant to 42 CFR  71.20 and as set forth in greater detail below, this Notice and Order prohibit	0	c
the introduction into the United States of any aircraft passenger departing from any foreign	0	c
country unless the passenger: (1) has a negative pre-departure test result for SARS-CoV-2, the	0	c
virus that causes COVID-19 (Qualifying Test); or (2) written or electronic documentation of	0	c
recovery from COVID-19 after previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in the form of a positive viral	0	c
test result and a letter from a licensed health care provider or public health official stating that	0	c
the passenger has been cleared for travel (Documentation of Recovery).	0	s
The negative pre-departure test must be a viral test that was conducted on a specimen collected	0	c
during the 3 days preceding the flight’s departure from a foreign country (Qualifying	0	c
Test).  Alternatively, if the passenger has recovered from COVID-19, the passenger may instead	0	c
travel with written or electronic documentation of a positive viral test result that confirms	0	c
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a letter from a licensed health care provider or public health	0	c
official stating that the passenger has been cleared for travel (Documentation of Recovery).  A	0	c
passenger must retain written or electronic documentation reflecting the negative Qualifying Test	0	c
result or Documentation of Recovery presented to the airline or other aircraft operator.  A	0	c
passenger must also produce such Qualifying Test result or Documentation of Recovery upon	0	c
request to any U.S. government official or a cooperating state or local public health authority.	0	s
Pursuant to 42 CFR 71.31(b) and as set forth in greater detail below, this Notice and Order	0	c
constitute a controlled free pratique to any airline or other aircraft operator with an aircraft	0	c
arriving into the United States.  Pursuant to this controlled free pratique, the airline or other	0	c
aircraft operator must comply with the following conditions to receive permission for the aircraft	0	c
to enter and disembark passengers in the United States:	0	d

BACKGROUND:	0	d
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world. Individuals who travel may be at	0	c
risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 before, during, and after travel.  This could result in US-	0	c
bound travelers further spreading the virus to others during travel, upon arrival in the United	0	c
States, and at their destinations.	0	s
Over the last few weeks, the United Kingdom (UK) has faced a rapid increase in COVID-19	0	c
cases in South East England, leading to enhanced epidemiological and virological	0	c
investigations.  On December 14, 2020, Public Health England announced that a new variant	0	c
of SARS-CoV-2 had been identified across the southeast of England.7  Preliminary analysis in	0	c
the UK suggests that this SARS-CoV-2 variant may be more transmissible than previously	0	c
circulating variants, with an estimated potential to increase the reproductive number (R0) by	0	c
0.4-0.7 or greater with an estimated increased transmissibility of up to 70 percent.8	0	s
On December 19, 2020, in response to the emergence of the UK variant, the countries	0	c
comprising the UK announced stricter measures to be applied from December 20 and over the	0	c
coming weeks, with affected areas entering a ‘Tier 4’ level with movement restrictions within	0	c
and between more and less heavily affected areas.  These measures have included	0	c
recommendations for residents of the most affected areas to restrict movements and travel,	0	c
including international travel, outside of these areas.  The government of Scotland announced	0	c
a travel ban between Scotland and the rest of the UK.  In addition, the Netherlands issued a	0	c
travel ban from the UK effective through January 1, 2021, and Belgium temporarily halted	0	c
flight and train travel from the UK.  Other countries took similar measures to restrict travel	0	c
from the UK.	0	s
A second new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the Republic of South Africa (RSA) on	0	c
December 18, 2020, that also appears to spread more rapidly than earlier variants of the virus.	0	c
The RSA variant is distinct from the UK variant but shares a mutation in the spike protein that	0	c
appears to increase transmissibility.  Since being identified, the new variant has spread inland	0	c
from coastal regions of RSA and has become the predominant variant in some areas of the	0	c

country.	0	s
During December 21-26, 2020, several countries implemented restrictions on travel from	0	c
South Africa, including China, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Panama, Sudan,	0	c
Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK.  The Netherlands imposed a ban on travel from RSA on	0	c
December 21 but lifted the ban for both the UK and RSA on December 23, stating that	0	c
travelers will instead need to present a negative COVID-19 test result obtained within 72	0	c
hours of their scheduled arrival in the Netherlands, followed by 10 days of self-quarantine.	0	c
On December 28, Japan imposed a ban on entry of all foreign nationals through the end of	0	c
January 2021.  On December 28, the Government of South Africa announced new restrictions	0	c
on businesses and public movement.  As of January 7, 2021, Canada requires air passengers 5	0	c
years of age or older to test negative for COVID-19 before arrival. On January 8, the United	0	c
Kingdom announced a pre-departure testing requirement for all inbound international travelers	0	c
with limited exceptions; a 10-day post-arrival quarantine will still be required.	0	s
On December 25, 2020, CDC issued an Order requiring proof of a negative Qualifying Test	0	c
result for all airline passengers arriving from the UK to the United States.  Since then, cases of	0	c
the UK and RSA variants have been discovered in four Canadian provinces, including in	0	c
individuals with no travel history indicating spread in Canada.  The UK variant has also been	0	c
found in at least 50 countries and the RSA variant has also been detected in at least 15	0	c
countries.  The first case of the UK variant in the United States was found in Colorado on	0	c
December 29, in an individual with no known travel history.  On December 30, a second case	0	c
was reported in California. Since then, the UK variant strain has accounted for 144 cases in 20	0	c
U.S. states. Another new variant strain of concern initially detected in South America in	0	c
March 2020 has been detected in at least 19 countries on 5 continents through late December	0	c
and has mutations in the spike protein that raise concerns of increased infectivity.	0	s
While it is known and expected that viruses constantly change through mutation leading to the	0	c
emergence of new variants, these new variants have emerged at a time when numbers of new	0	c
cases in the United States have continued to increase at alarming rates.  Additional new virus	0	c
variants are also likely to emerge as the virus continues to evolve and mutate.  Accordingly,	0	c
further action is needed to help mitigate the spread of these and other new virus variants into	0	c
the United States.	0	s
Based on increased transmissibility and spread of these new variants of SARS-CoV-2, and to	0	c
reduce introduction and spread of these and future SARS-CoV-2 variants into the United States,	0	c
expanding current UK pre-departure testing requirements to all foreign countries and  U.S.-	0	c
bound passengers is warranted.  This approach to testing-based risk assessment has been	0	c
addressed in CDC guidance and the Runway to Recovery guidance jointly issued by the	0	c
Departments of Transportation, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services.9  Testing	0	c
for SARS-CoV-2 infection is a proactive approach and not dependent on the infecting strain.	0	c
9 Runway to Recovery 1.1, December 21, 2020, available at	0	x
https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/runway-recovery-11	0	x
6	0	e
Approximately 120 countries now use testing in some form to monitor risk and control	0	c
introduction and spread.  With case counts and deaths due to COVID-19 continuing to increase	0	c
around the globe and the high proportion of infected people with asymptomatic or pre-	0	c
symptomatic infections, the United States must take a dual approach to combatting the virus.	0	c
This means concurrently mitigating and slowing the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2	0	c
and controlling transmission within U.S. communities that are currently being overwhelmed by a	0	c
surge in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.	0	s
Pre-departure testing may detect travelers infected with SARS-CoV-2 before they initiate their	0	c
travel.  CDC recommends viral testing and receipt of results 1-3 days10 before departure for	0	c
international travelers, particularly those traveling long distances or passing through	0	c
transportation hubs such as airports where social distancing may be challenging.  CDC modeling	0	c
indicates that pre-departure testing is most effective when combined with self-monitoring.11	0	c
Testing before departure results in the greatest reduction of transmission risk during travel when	0	c
the specimen is collected close to the time of departure.  Earlier testing (i.e., more than  3 days	0	c
before travel) provides little benefit beyond what self-monitoring alone can provide.	0	s
For persons previously diagnosed with COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery,	0	c
CDC does not  recommended retesting within 3 months after the date of symptom onset (or the	0	c
date of first positive viral diagnostic test if their infection was asymptomatic) for the initial	0	c
SARS-CoV-2 infection.12  Persons who develop any symptoms of COVID-19 during this time	0	c
period should not travel and seek care for testing and evaluation. This guidance may be updated	0	c
as additional information about people who have recovered from COVID-19 becomes available.	0	s
Pre-departure testing does not eliminate all risk.  However, when pre-departure testing is	0	c
combined with other measures such as self-monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19, wearing	0	c
masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene, it can make travel safer by reducing spread on	0	c
conveyances, in transportation hubs, and at destinations.  For international air travelers and	0	c
others with higher risk of exposure, CDC additionally recommends a post-arrival test 3-5 days	0	c
after arrival at destination, combined with self-monitoring and a 7-day period of staying home	0	c
(or in a comparable location such as a hotel room) to further reduce the risk of translocating the	0	c
virus into destination communities.13	0	s
As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise across the globe and travel volume increases, routine pre-	0	c
departure testing of all U.S.-bound aircraft passengers is needed not only to reduce introduction	0	c
