MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES	0	x
FROM:        Russell T.  Vought	0	x
Acting Director	0	x
SUBJECT:   Enabling Mission Delivery through Improved Identity, Credential, and Access	0	x
Management	0	x
This memorandum sets forth the Federal Government's 1 Identity, Credential, and Access	0	c
Management (ICAM) policy and includes the following sections:	0	d
I.    Contextualizing Identity in the Federal Government	0	s
II.  Managing Identities, Credentials, and Access in Modern Government	0	s
III.  Adapting the Government's Approach to Homeland Security Presidential	0	c
Directive 12 (HSPD-12)	0	s
IV.    Shifting the Operating Model beyond the Perimeter	0	s
V.    Improving Digital Interactions with the American Public	0	s
VI.    Enumerating Government-wide Responsibilities	-1	s
I.  Contextualizing Identity in the Federal Government	0	d
For the purposes of this policy, "identity" refers to the unique representation of a subject,	0	c
for example, a person, a device, a non-person entity (NPE), or an automated technology, that is	0	c
engaged in a transaction involving at least one Federal subject or a Federal resource, for	0	c
example, Federal information, a Federal information system,2  or a Federal facility or secured	0	c
area.  This policy may refer to identity in two contexts: (1) Federal enterprise identity or (2)	0	c
public identity.  Federal enterprise identity, or, simply, enterprise identity, refers to the unique	0	c
representation of an employee, a contractor, an enterprise user, such as a mission or business	0	c
partner, a device, or a technology that a Federal agency manages to achieve its mission and	0	c
business objectives.  Public identity refers to the unique representation of a subject that a Federal	0	c
agency interacts with, but does not directly manage, in order to achieve its mission and business	0	c
objectives.  Public identity may also refer to a mechanism of trust used to render services to the	0	c
American public.	20	s
1 This memorandum is not applicable to national security systems (NSS) as defined in 44 U.S.C.  § 3552 (Federal	0	x
Information Security Modernization Act of2014), although 0MB encourages owners and operators ofNSS to	0	x
utilize the requirements in this document where appropriate.	0	x
2 Pursuant to 0MB Circular A-130, "information system" means a discrete set of information resources organized	0	x
for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.	0	x
II. Managing Identities, Credentials, and Access in Modern Government	0	d
Advances in technology have enabled more digital interactions and business transactions,	0	c
offering the Federal Government an opportunity for faster,  more reliable connections and	0	c
operations.  In conjunction with this opportunity, however, a new set of challenges has emerged,	0	c
because information about individuals has become more widely available through social media	0	c
and breaches of personally identifiable information (PII).3  In favor of this opportunity, the	0	c
Federal Government continues to refresh its digital infrastructure through comprehensive efforts	0	c
focused on cybersecurity, procurement, and management of a workforce capable of operating	0	c
modem, frequently cloud-based environments.  To address the challenges that have emerged	0	c
alongside this opportunity, embedded within these efforts is an intensified focus on risk	0	c
management and the adoption of processes, policies, and solutions that enhanc〜 privacy and	0	c
security and that mitigate the degradation of operational service delivery.  Accordingly, identity	0	c
management has become even more critical to the Federal Government's successful delivery of	0	c
mission and business promises to the American public.  As such, through this Federal ICAM	0	c
policy, the Government is enacting a common vision for identity as an enabler of mission	0	c
delivery, trust, and safety of the Nation.	0	s
To ensure secure and efficient operations, agencies of the Federal Government must be	0	c
able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage subjects thataccess Federal resources,	0	c
including information, information systems, facilities, and secured areas across their respective	0	c
enterprises.  In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing, establish enterprise digital	0	c
identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control significantly affects	0	c
the security and delivery of their services, as well as individuals' privacy. 4	0	s
Furthermore, in line with the Federal Government's updated approach to modernization,	0	c
it is essential that agencies' ICAM strategies and solutions shift from the obsolete Levels of	0	c
Assurance (LOA)5 model towards a new model informed by risk management perspectives, the	0	c
Federal resource accessed, and outcomes aligned to agency missions.  To set the foundation for	0	c
identity management and its usage to access physical and digital resources, agencies must	0	c
implement National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-	0	c
63-3  and any successive versions (hereafter referred to as NIST SP 800.:.63).  While NIST SP	0	c
800-63  is the foundation for digital identity, agencies must use it in combination with the	0	c
remaining suite of publications that relate to identity management issued by NIST, the Office of	0	c
3 Per 0MB Circular A-130, "Personally Identifiable Information" means information that can be used to distinguish	0	x
or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a	0	x
specific individual.	0	x
4 For definitions of terms such as  digital identity, identity proofing, federation,  and credential, see NIST Special	0	x
Publication (SP) 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines (or any successive version) available· at	0	x
5  The concept of LOA as  a single ordinal that drives implementation-specific requirement is retired. Rather, the	0	x
updates to NIST 800-63-3 combine appropriate business and privacy risk management with mission need, and	0	x
separate the individual elements of identity assurance into discrete, component parts.	0	x
2	0	e
Personnel Management (OPM), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to form a	0	c
comprehensive approach to identity proofing that safeguards privacy and security. 6	38	s
III. Adapting the Government's Approach to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12	0	c
(HSPD-12)	0	d
HSPD-12 remains the Government-wide policy for the promulgation of standards-based,	0	c
secure, and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees,	0	c
contractors, and other enterprise users.  Additionally, Federal Information Processing Standard	0	c
(FIPS) 201-2, Personal Identity  Verification (PIV)  ofFederal Employees and Contractors (or	0	c
successive version),7 remains the Government-wide standard for common identification, as	0	c
called for by HSPD-12.  In accordance with this standard, NIST guidelines, and Office of	0	c
Personnel Management (OPM) requirements, a PIV credential is the aggregate output of the	0	c
processes used for identity proofing, vetting, and authoritatively binding the identity of a human	0	c
credential holder to an authenticator.  However, as technology evolves, the Government must	0	c
offer flexible solutions to meet changing technology needs and shift the focus from managing the	0	c
lifecycle of credentials to the lifecycle of identities.	0	d
1.  Agencies shall follow the requirements issued by OPM regarding the eligibility to issue,	0	c
suspend, and revoke PIV credentials. 8	0	s
2.  Agencies shall require PIV credentials (where applicable in accordance with OPM	0	c
requirements) as the primary means of identification and authentication to Federal	0	c
information systems and Federally controlled facilities and secured areas by Federal	0	c
employees and contractors.	0	d
•  Agencies shall use Derived PIV Credentials9 for Federal employees, contractors,	0	c
and other enterprise users (where applicable in accordance with OPM	0	c
requirements) and to enable the acceptance of Derived PIV Credentials by	0	c
applications and devices.	0	s

3	0	e
•  Agencies shall work with the Federal CIO Council, the Federal Privacy Council,	0	c
ari.d NIST to pilot10  additional solutions (e.g., different authenticators) that meet	0	c
the intent of HSPD-12 and advance the technical approach to managing identities.	0	c
The output of these pilots will drive improvements to NIST guidelines and	0	c
Government-wide ICAM requirements including areas such as mobile and cloud	0	c
identity.	0	s
•  Agencies shall implement processes to inanage access control, including the	0	c
ability to revoke access privileges, when no longer authorized, and to revoke or	0	c
destroy credentials in a timely manner.  This is necessary to prevent unauthorized	0	c
access to information systems when the employee or contractor separates from the	0	c
agency, or the credential has been lost.  Additionally, this serves to mitigate	0	c
insider threats associated with compromised or potentially compromised	0	c
credentials.	0	s
•  Agencies shall ensure that use of the PIV credential for physical access to Federal	0	c
facilities and secured areas is implemented in accordance with The Risk	0	c
Management Process for Federal Facilities: An Interagency Security Committee	0	c
Standard (or any successive version)11  and NIST SP 800-116 Rl, Guidelines for	0	c
the  Use  ofPIV Credentials in Facility Access (or any successive version). 12	98	s
3.  Agencies, in collaboration with 0MB as necessary, shall support cross-government	0	c
identity federation and interoperability by identifying and resolving obstacles to	0	c
accepting the PIV identity assertions from other agencies to grant access ( where	0	c
authorized) to agency information systems, facilities, and secured areas.  This includes:	0	d
•  Implementing processes for the electronic verification of PIV identity assertions	0	c
from other agencies.	0	s
•  Accepting and leveraging existing, valid PIV credentials, including those issued	0	c
by other agencies and electronically verified, rather than issuing new ones.  This	0	c
is equally applicable for logical and physical access (where authorized).	0	s
10  Information on the process for requesting pilots is available at https://www.cio.gov/.	0	x
11  The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities: An lntefagency Security Committee Standard defines the	0	x
criteria and processes that those responsible for the security of a facility should use to determine its facility security	0	x
level, and provides an integrated, single source of physical security countermeasures. The guidance is _available at	0	x
h  s://www.dhs.  ov/  ublications.                                                                  ·	0	x
12  NIST 800  116 Rl (or any successive version) contains guidance on the use of PIV credentials in physical access	0	x
control systems (P ACS). P ACS are information systems, and they include, for example, servers, databases,	0	x
workstations,  and network appliances in either shared or isolated networks. The guidance is available at	0	x
https://csrc.nist.gov/publications.	0	x
4	0	e
•  Establishing and maintaining agreements ( where required) to facilitate cross	0	c
government identity federation.	134	s
4;  Agencies shall establish capabilities aligned to Federal ICAM Architecture and	0	c
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) 13  requirements that enable the continuous	0	c
vetting and evaluation of fitness of personnel subject to HSPD-12.	0	d
•  These capabilities will strengthen the Federal Government's approach to make	0	c
risk〜adaptive decisions regarding access to information systems, facilities, and	0	c
secured areas as intended by HSPD-12.	154	s
5.  Agencies shall require and implement the use of the PIV credential digital signature	0	c
capability.  For individuals that fall outside the scope of PIV applicability, agencies	0	c
should define and leverage credentials when using digital signatures.	0	s
6.  Agencies should use PIV credentials as a method to encrypt information in transit and	0	c
shared between two or more Federal employees or contractors.	81	s
IV. Shifting the Operating Model beyond the Perimeter	0	d
The interwoven technical architecture of the Federal Government creates complexity in	0	c
managing access to resources, safeguarding networks, and protecting information.  While	0	c
hardening the perimeter is important, agencies must shift from simply managing access inside	0	c
and outside of the perimeter to using identity as the underpinning for managing the risk posed by	0	c
attempts to access Federal resources made by users and information systems.  To ignite adoption	0	c
of this new mindset around ICAM capability deployment across the Federal Government, each	0	c
agency must harmonize its enterprise-wide approach to governance, architecture, and	0	c
acquisition.	0	s
Governance	0	d
1.  Each agency shall designate an integrated agency-wide ICAM office, team, or other	0	c
governance structure 14  in support of its Enterprise Risk Management capability to	0	c
effectively govern and enforce ICAM efforts.	0	d
13  The CDM program enhances the overall security and privacy posture of the Federal government by providing	0	x
Federal agencies with capabilities to reduce the attack surface of their respective networks, identify cybersecurity	0	x
risks, and enable agencies to prioritize actions to mitigate or accept risks based on the potential impacts to their	0	x
missions.  CDM accomplishes this by working with agencies to deploy tools on agency networks that provide	0	x
enterprise-wide visibility of what assets, users, and activities are on their networks. This actionable information	0	x
allows agencies-to effectively monitor, defend, and rapidly respond to cyber incidents. Information on CDM is	0	x
available at https://www.dhs.gov/cdm.	0	x
14  Examples ofICAM governance structures is available at https://www.idmanagement.gov/.	0	x
5	0	e
•  This structure should include personnel from the offices of the Chief Information	0	c
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Human Resources, General Counsel, Chief	0	c
Information Security Officer, Senior Agency Official for Privacy, Chief	0	c
Acquisition Officer, Senior Official(s) responsible for Physical Security, and	0	c
component organizations that manage ICAM programs and capabilities, including	0	c
ICAM capabilities deployed through the CDM Program.	0	s
•  Chief Operating Officers (COOs) 15  or the agency equivalent role shall ensure that	0	c
there is regular coordination among agency leaders and mission owners to	0	c
implement, manage, and maintain the agency's ICAM policies, processes, and	0	c
technologies.	0	s
•  While the agency governance structure described above will facilitate oversight of	0	c
the implementation of Government-wide and agency enterprise-specific	0	c
requirements, all bureaus, components, and other organizations at the sub	0	c
enterprise level must support efforts to harmonize ICAM across their respective	0	c
agency by adhering to requirements and fostering accountability at all levels of	0	c
the organization.	175	s
2.  Each agency shall define and maintain a single comprehensive ICAM policy, process,	0	c
and technology solution roadmap, consistent with agency authorities and operational	0	c
mission needs.  These items should encompass the agency's entire enterprise, align with	0	c
the Government-wide Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)	0	c
Architecture and CDM requirements, incorporate applicable Federal policies, standards,	0	c
playbooks, and guidelines, and include roles and responsibilities for all users. 16	0	s
3.  Each agency shall outline agency-wide performance expectations for security and privacy	0	c
risk management throughout the identity lifecycle.  These performance expectations shall	0	c
support Government-wide management requirements, such as the President's	0	c
Management Agenda (PMA) Cross Agency Priority (CAP) goals.	0	d
•  Agencies shall incorporate objectives for improving ICAM into their strategic	0	c
plans and review their progress with 0MB as part of their strategic reviews. 17	210	s
15  Per M-18-19, the COO is responsible for providing overall organization management to improve and achieve the	0	x
mission and goals of the agency.  COOs provide organizational leadership to improve performance of both mission	0	x
and management functions.  For more information, refer to https://www.whitehouse . ..,ov/omb/infonnation-for	0	x

4.  Each agency shall incorporate Digital Identity Risk Management18  into existing Federal	0	c
processes as outlined in NIST SP 800-63, including the selection of assurance levels	0	c
commensurate with the risk to their digital service offerings. 19	0	d
•  Agencies shall use these levels to make risk-informed decisions when selecting	0	c
and using processes and technologies implemented across the ICAM	0	c
environment.	0	s
•  Agencies shall update legacy e-Authentication risk assessments to shift away	0	c
from the obsolete LOA model.	0	s
•  Agencies shall coordinate with state, local, and tribal governments, other entities,	0	c
and individuals to provide identity verification and access control appropriate to	0	c
the risk level and performance of the business function in cases where information	0	c
sharing or collection is required for business and mission functions.	0	s
•  Agencies shall share feedback on their implementation of the Digital Identity Risk	0	c
Management process with the Federal CIO Council, Federal Privacy Council, and	0	c
NIST to drive improvements to NIST SP 800-63.	172	s
Architecture	0	d
1.  Agencies shall establish authoritative solutions for their ICAM services20 by rationalizing	0	c
the ICAM capabilities that they will keep, replace, retire, or consolidate.  Agencies are	0	c
encouraged to promote flexible and scalable solutions that can work across the agency	0	c
and change as mission needs evolve.	0	s
2.  Agencies shall ensure that deployed ICAM capabilities are interchangeable, use	0	c
commercially available products, and leverage open Application Programming Interfaces	0	c
(APis) and commercial standards to enable componentized development and promote	0	c
interoperability across all levels of government.	0	s
3.  Agencies shall manage the digital identity lifecycle of devices, non-person entities	0	c
(NPEs), and automated technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools	0	c
and Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensuring the digital identity is distinguishable, auditable,	0	c
and consistently managed across the agency.  This includes establishing mechanisms to	0	c
bind, update, revoke, and destroy credentials for the device or automated technology.	0	s
18  Requirements in NIST SP 800-63 provide specific g4idance related to digital identity risk (inclusive of privacy)	0	x
that agency relying parties apply while executing all relevantRMF lifecycle phases. Digital identity risk	0	x
management does not establish additional risk management processes for agencies.	0	x
19  Federal employees and contractors are required to be identity proofed and credentialed in accordance with 0MB	0	x
and OPM policy.  Therefore, digital identity risk assessments described in NIST SP 800-63  complement, rather than	0	x
supersede, the guidance and requirements ofHSPD-12.	0	x
7	0	e
4.  Agencies that are authoritative sources for attributes ( e.g., SSN) utilized in identity	0	c
proofing· events, as selected by 0MB and permissible by law, shall establish privacy	0	c
enhanced data validation APis for public and private sector identity proofing services to	0	c
consume, providing a mechanism to improve the assurance of digital identity verification	0	c
transactions based on consumer consent.	0	d
•  These selected agencies, in coordination with 0MB, shall establish standard	0	c
processes and terms of use for public and private sector identity proofing services	0	c
that want to consume the APis.	260	s
5.  Agencies shall leverage federated solutions to accept identity and authentication	0	c
assertions made by mission and business partners.	0	d
•  Agencies shall accept assertions by partners based on digital identity risk and	0	c
associated assurance levels in accordance with NIST guidelines and Government	0	c
wide ICAM requirements. 21	0	s
•  Agencies shall confirm that these assertions use open commercially available	0	c
standards to the extent available.                                             ·	235	s
Acquisition	0	d
1.  · Agencies shall require all contracts requiring contractors to have access to Federally	0	c
controlled facilities or access to Federally controlled information systems to include a	0	c
requirement to comply with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201  for affected contractor personnel	0	c
based on OPM requirements and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).22	0	s
2.  Agencies shall confirm that products and services acquired to further their HSPD-12	0	c
and ICAM implementations are compliant with 0MB policy, NIST standards, and	0	c
supporting technical specifications.23	0	s
3.  Agencies shall leverage approved Best in Class and Tier 2 contract vehicles, 24 or	0	c
Federally provided shared services, to procure digital certificates for identification and	0	c
authentication of Federal enterprise identities.	0	s

4.  Agencies shall leverage the CDM Program to accelerate their procurement and	0	c
deployment of tools related to the ICAM capabilities in Phase 2 or future phases.	0	d
•  Agencies shall work with the CDM Program to understand requirements·and	0	c
identify future CDM phase capabilities that support ICAM goals.	163	s
V.  Improving Digital Interactions with the American Public	0	d
Improving the trust and safety of transactions with the public across the Federal Government is	0	c
critical to digital service delivery.  It is imperative that agencies manage the risk to services and	0	c
public user data at a level commensurate with the risk inherent to the digital offering as well as	0	c
with the sensitivity of the data collected to provide the digital offering.	0	d
1.  Agencies shall ensure that identity proofing for Federal digital services provided to public	0	c
consumers aligns with NIST guidance and Government-wide ICAM requirements.	0	s
2.  Agencies shall limit the collection of PII for establishing an individual's identity to that	0	c
which is legally authorized, relevant, and deemed reasonably necessary.	0	d
• . Once collected, agencies shall ensure that PII is protected commensurate with the	0	c
level of risk it harbors, which may include the implementation of robust practices	0	c
, and technologies.	305	s
3.  Agencies shall establish processes based on digital identity risk and associated assurance	0	c
levels to allow an individual to bind, update, use, and disassociate non-Government	0	c
furnished authenticators to their digital identity when accessing Federal digital services	0	c
provided to public consumers.	0	s
4.  Agencies shall leverage existing credentials and identity federations that meet the	0	c
agency's determined acceptable risk level rather than standing up processes or	0	c
capabilities to issue new credentials to users.	0	s
5.  Agencies shall use Federally provided or commercially provided shared services,25  to the	0	c
extent available, to deliver identity assurance and authentication services to the public.	0	d
•  These shared services shall align with NIST SP 800-63  security and privacy	0	c
requirements.	0	s
•  With appropriate consent and privacy protections, agencies should share proofing	0	c
confirmations across agencies to reduce public burden for having to submit	0	c
identity data more than once to access Federal Government services.	0	s
9	0	e
•  Where appropriate, and when individuals' consent is not obtainable, agencies	0	c
should modify existing Privacy Act system of record notices to include routine	0	c
uses permitting the disclosure of proofing information to reduce public burden for	0	c
having to submit identity data more than once to access Federal Government	0	c
services.	0	s
•  Agencies should solicit and document direct feedback from consumers to	0	c
determine whether there is demand for the use of other service providers. If	0	c
consumers demand a certain service provider and the provider meets the mission	0	c
requirements, agencies should consider federating with that credential provider.	0	s
•  Agencies should use shared service providers that leverage more than one	0	c
solution to enhance enterprise resiliency in case of a compromise or other service	0	c
failure.	297	s
