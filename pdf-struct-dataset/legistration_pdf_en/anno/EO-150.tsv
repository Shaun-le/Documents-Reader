EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 150	0	x
WHEREAS, in light of the dangers posed by Coronavirus disease	0	c
2019  (“COVID-19”),  I  issued  Executive  Order  No.  103  on	0	c
March 9, 2020, the facts and circumstances of which are adopted by	0	c
reference  herein,  which  declared  both  a  Public  Health  Emergency	0	c
and State of Emergency; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  through  Executive  Order  Nos.  119  and  138  (2020),	0	c
issued on April 7, 2020, and May 6, 2020, respectively, the facts	0	c
and  circumstances  of  which  are  adopted  by  reference  herein,  I	0	c
declared  that  the  COVID-19  Public  Health  Emergency  continued  to	0	c
exist  and  declared  that  all  Executive  Orders  and  Administrative	0	c
Orders  adopted  in  whole  or  in  part  in  response  to  the  COVID-19	0	c
Public Health Emergency remained in full force and effect; and	0	s
WHEREAS, in accordance with N.J.S.A. App. A:9-34 and -51, I	0	c
reserve the right to utilize and employ all available resources of	0	c
State  government  to  protect  against  the  emergency  created  by	0	c
COVID-19; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  as  COVID-19  continued  to  spread  across  New  Jersey	0	c
and an increasing number of individuals required medical care or	0	c
hospitalization, I issued a series of Executive Orders pursuant to	0	c
my  authority  under  the  New  Jersey  Civilian  Defense  and  Disaster	0	c
Control  Act  and  the  Emergency  Health  Powers  Act,  to  protect  the	0	c
public health, safety, and welfare against the emergency created	0	c
by COVID-19, including Executive Order Nos. 104-133, Nos. 135-138,	0	c
and Nos. 140-149 (2020), the facts and circumstances of which are	0	c
all adopted by reference herein; and	0	s
WHEREAS, on March 16, 2020, I signed Executive Order No. 104,	0	c
which  limited  all  restaurants,  dining  establishments,  and  food	0	c
courts, with or without a liquor license, all bars, and all other	0	c
holders of a liquor license with retail consumption privileges, to	0	c
2	0	e
offering food delivery and/or take-out services only, meaning that	0	c
they  could  not  allow  the  on-premises  consumption  of  food  or	0	c
beverages; and	0	s
WHEREAS, on March 21, 2020, I signed Executive Order No. 107,	0	c
which  superseded  Executive  Order  No.  104  (2020)  in  full  but	0	c
continued  the  prohibition  of  on-premises  consumption  of  food  or	0	c
beverages; and	0	s
WHEREAS, given the decrease in the rate of reported new cases	0	c
of COVID-19 in New Jersey, in the total number of individuals being	0	c
admitted to hospitals for COVID-19, and in the rate of reproduction	0	c
for COVID-19 infections in New Jersey, the State can begin to take	0	c
certain steps to lift certain restrictions that were designed to	0	c
limit person-to-person contact; and	0	s
WHEREAS, even as the rate of reported new cases of COVID-19	0	c
decreases, the ongoing risks presented by COVID-19 mean that many	0	c
of  the  State’s  current  measures  must  remain  in  place,  both  to	0	c
reduce additional new infections and to save lives; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  after  consultation  with  officials  from  the	0	c
Department  of  Health  (“DOH”),  I  announced  a  multi-stage	0	c
New Jersey’s  Road  Back  Plan  (“Plan”)  for  the  methodical  and	0	c
strategic  reopening  of  businesses  and  activities  based  on	0	c
scientific  data  and  metrics  concerning  the  level  of  disease	0	c
transmission risk and essential classification; and	0	s
WHEREAS, the State is implementing its reopening process and	0	c
has begun to relax restrictions on certain businesses, including	0	c
the authorization of curbside pickup at retail establishments, the	0	c
resumption of non-essential construction, and the allowance of a	0	c
number of lower-risk outdoor activities; and	0	s
3	0	e
WHEREAS, consistent with this Plan, I have issued a number of	0	c
Executive  Orders,  including  Executive  Order  Nos.  133,  142,  143,	0	c
146,  and  147  (2020),  which  authorized  the  openings  of  parks,	0	c
beaches, lakefronts, and several outdoor recreational facilities	0	c
and activities, with social distancing, cleaning, sanitizing, and	0	c
hygiene  practices  in  place,  given  repeated  observations  from	0	c
public  health  experts,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  Centers	0	c
for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (“CDC”),  that  outdoor	0	c
environments  present  reduced  risks  of  COVID-19  transmission  as	0	c
compared to indoor environments; and	0	s
WHEREAS, consistent with this Plan, I issued Executive Order	0	c
No. 148 (2020), which allowed additional numbers of individuals to	0	c
gather  outdoors,  consistent  with  the  same  repeated  observations	0	c
from  public  health  experts,  and  Executive  Order  No.  149  (2020),	0	c
which  authorized  the  gradual  restart  of  ordinary  child  care	0	c
services,  certain  youth  sporting  activities,  and  summer  camps,	0	c
with social distancing requirements; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  consistent  with  this  Plan,  non-essential  retail	0	c
businesses  can  begin  to  open  their  brick-and-mortar  premises  to	0	c
the  public,  but  should  be  held  to  the  same  minimum  requirements	0	c
that have applied to essential retail businesses since Executive	0	c
Order No. 122 (2020) was signed in early April; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  given  the  reduced  risks  of  COVID-19  transmission	0	c
outdoors, the State can begin to allow restaurants, bars, and other	0	c
food  or  beverage  establishments  to  provide  in-person  service  at	0	c
areas  designated  for  food  and/or  beverage  consumption	0	c
(“outdoor dining”) in accordance with CDC and DOH safeguards, but	0	c
indoor  dining  still  poses  a  higher  risk  of  transmission  at  this	0	c
time than outdoor dining; and	0	s
4	0	e
WHEREAS, indoor dining also entails a higher risk than indoor	0	c
retail operations, as indoor dining typically involves individuals	0	c
sitting together in one location for a prolonged period of time,	0	c
while in indoor retail settings, individuals neither congregate in	0	c
large  groups  nor  remain  in  close  proximity  for  extended  periods	0	c
and so the risk of COVID-19 spread is reduced; and	0	s
WHEREAS, to limit the spread of COVID-19 and thus to protect	0	c
public health, establishments can only open to the public to offer	0	c
outdoor  dining  where  such  food  and/or  beverage  consumption  is	0	c
conducted  in  a  way  that  ensures  groups  of  individuals  will  be	0	c
appropriately  spaced  apart,  and  there  must  be  strict  limits  in	0	c
place governing when individuals may enter the premises; and	0	s
WHEREAS, to limit the spread of COVID-19 and thus to protect	0	c
public health, establishments can only open to the public to offer	0	c
outdoor  dining  where  such  food  and/or  beverage  consumption  is	0	c
conducted in a way that ensures critical Statewide health standards	0	c
are met, which are being issued simultaneously by DOH; and	0	s
WHEREAS, because this Order establishes options for outdoor	0	c
food  and/or  beverage  consumption  that  accommodate  the  lack  of	0	c
indoor  dining  options  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  individuals  must	0	c
have  access  to  the  same  smoke-free  options  that  they  would  have	0	c
had under State law at the indoor premises of a food or beverage	0	c
establishment, and which will continue to ensure that individuals	0	c
can  access  in-person  dining  options  without  exposure  to	0	c
second-hand smoke during the Public Health Emergency; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  many  restaurants  or  bars  will  not  have  sufficient	0	c
outdoor  space  to  serve  their  patrons,  and  thus  may  seek  to  use	0	c
additional  space  for  outdoor  food  and/or  beverage  consumption,	0	c
5	0	e
including other areas of their property, such as parking lots, and	0	c
shared spaces, such as sidewalks, streets, and parks; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  municipalities  are  in  the  best  position  to  make	0	c
decisions on allowing restaurants or bars to expand their service	0	c
footprint on their property and potentially into shared spaces in	0	c
a way that comports with public safety; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  if  municipalities  choose  to  make  shared  spaces	0	c
available  to  restaurants  or  bars,  it  is  incumbent  upon  them  to	0	c
distribute  these  spaces  equitably  among  restaurants  or  bars  who	0	c
may feasibly seek to use them; and	0	s
WHEREAS,  the  Constitution  and  statutes  of  the  State  of	0	c
New Jersey,  particularly  the  provisions  of  N.J.S.A.  26:13-1	0	c
et seq.,  N.J.S.A.  App.  A:  9-33  et  seq.,  N.J.S.A.  38A:3-6.1,  and	0	c
N.J.S.A.  38A:2-4  and  all  amendments  and  supplements  thereto,	0	c
confer  upon  the  Governor  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey  certain	0	c
emergency powers, which I have invoked;	0	s
NOW, THEREFORE, I, PHILIP D. MURPHY, Governor of the State of	0	c
New  Jersey,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the	0	c
Constitution  and  by  the  Statutes  of  this  State,  do  hereby  ORDER	0	c
and DIRECT:	0	d
1.    Effective  at  6:00  a.m.  on  Monday,  June  15,  2020,	0	c
restaurants, cafeterias, dining establishments, and food courts,	0	c
with or without a liquor license, bars, and all other holders of	0	c
a liquor license with retail consumption privileges, collectively	0	c
referred to as “food or beverage establishments,” are permitted to	0	c
offer  in-person  service  at  outdoor  areas,  provided  that  the	0	c
establishment complies with the following requirements:	0	d
6	0	e
a.    Ensure  all  areas  designated  for  food  and/or	0	c
beverage  consumption  are  in  conformance  with	0	c
applicable local, State, and Federal regulations;	0	s
b.    Limit capacity to a number that ensures all patrons	0	c
can remain six feet apart from all other patrons at	0	c
all times, except for those patrons with whom they	0	c
are sharing a table;	0	s
c.    Satisfy  all  standards  issued  by  DOH  pursuant  to	0	c
Paragraph 3 of this Order;	0	s
d.    Ensure  that  tables  seating  individual  groups  are	0	c
six  feet  apart  in  all  directions  and  that	0	c
individual  seats  in  any  shared  area  that  is  not	0	c
reserved for individual groups, such as an outdoor	0	c
bar area, are also six feet apart in all directions;	0	s
e.    Prohibit patrons from entering the indoor premises	0	c
of  the  food  or  beverage  establishment,  except  to	0	c
walk through such premises when entering or exiting	0	c
the  food  or  beverage  establishment  in  order  to	0	c
access the outdoor area, or to use the restroom;	0	s
f.    Require  patrons  to  wear  a  face  covering  while	0	c
inside the indoor premises of the food or beverage	0	c
establishment,  unless  the  patron  has  a  medical	0	c
reason  for  not  doing  so  or  is  a  child  under  two	0	c
years of age; and	0	s
g.    Prohibit  smoking  in  any  outdoor  areas  designated	0	c
for the consumption of food and/or beverages.  The	0	c
requirement  that  food  or  beverage  establishments	0	c
impose this prohibition shall automatically sunset	0	c
7	0	e
once food or beverage establishments are permitted	0	c
to offer in-person service in indoor areas.	146	s
2.    Nothing in this Order shall prevent a food or beverage	0	c
establishment  that  offers  take-out  options  from  allowing  an	0	c
individual  who  is  seeking  take-out  rather  than  table  service  to	0	c
enter the indoor premises of the establishment to place an order,	0	c
make  payment,  and  pick  up  food  or  beverages,  including  in	0	c
situations  where  a  food  or  beverage  establishment  makes  outdoor	0	c
areas without table service available.  As noted in Paragraph 1(f),	0	c
such individuals shall wear a face covering while inside the indoor	0	c
premises  of  the  food  or  beverage  establishment,  unless  the	0	c
individual  has  a  medical  reason  for  not  doing  so  or  is  a  child	0	c
under two years of age.	0	s
3.    The Commissioner of the DOH is directed, consistent with	0	c
her  authority  under  the  Emergency  Health  Powers  Act,  to  issue	0	c
health  and  safety  standards  for  use  by  food  or  beverage	0	c
establishments  in  order  to  serve  patrons  consistent  with  this	0	c
Order.	0	s
4.    Picnic  Areas  and  Pavilions  may  be  open  to  the  public.	0	c
Picnic Areas and Pavilions shall be open to the public at all State	0	c
Parks and Forests.	0	s
5.    Municipalities  are  permitted  to  use  their  existing	0	c
authority to allow food or beverage establishments to expand their	0	c
footprint to outdoor areas, both within their property and among	0	c
municipally-governed  areas,  including  but  not  limited  to	0	c
sidewalks, streets, or parks.  Any additional density and social	0	c
distancing  requirements  imposed  by  municipalities  on  food  or	0	c
beverage  establishments  offering  in-person  service  at  outdoor	0	c
areas  are  not  inconsistent  with  Executive  Order  No.  108  (2020).	0	c
8	0	e
If a municipality seeks to close off a roadway for which it would	0	c
need county or State approval, it still must obtain that approval.	0	s
6.    Municipalities that make outdoor shared spaces such as	0	c
sidewalks, streets, or parks, available for use by food or beverage	0	c
establishments should equitably divide these spaces among food or	0	c
beverage establishments that can feasibly use it.	0	s
7.    Paragraph 8 of Executive Order No. 107 (2020), Paragraph	0	c
2 of Executive Order No. 133 (2020), Paragraph 2 of Executive Order	0	c
No. 143 (2020), Paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 147 (2020), and	0	c
Paragraph 10 of Executive Order No. 148 (2020) are superseded to	0	c
the extent inconsistent with this Order.	0	s
8.    Effective  at  6:00  a.m.  on  Monday,  June  15,  2020,  the	0	c
brick-and-mortar premises of non-essential retail businesses that	0	c
were  closed  to  the  public  by  Executive  Order  No.  107  (2020)  can	0	c
reopen to the public, provided that such businesses adopt policies	0	c
that  include,  at  minimum,  the  requirements  that  were  applied  to	0	c
essential retail businesses in Paragraph 1 of Executive Order No.	0	c
122 (2020).	0	s
9.    It shall be the duty of every person or entity in this	0	c
State or doing business in this State and of the members of the	0	c
governing  body  and  every  official,  employee,  or  agent  of  every	0	c
political subdivision in this State and of each member of all other	0	c
governmental  bodies,  agencies,  and  authorities  in  this  State  of	0	c
any nature whatsoever, to cooperate fully in all matters concerning	0	c
this Order.	0	s
10.  Penalties  for  violations  of  this  Order  may  be  imposed	0	c
under, among other statutes, N.J.S.A. App. A:9-49 and -50.	0	s

11.  The State Director of Emergency Management, who is the	0	c
Superintendent of State Police, shall have the discretion to make	0	c
additions,  amendments,  clarifications,  exceptions  and  exclusions	0	c

political  subdivision  of  this  State  shall  enact  or  enforce  any	0	c
order,  rule,  regulation,  ordinance,  or  resolution  which  will  or	0	c
might in any way conflict with any of the provisions of Executive	0	c
Order No. 150 (2020), or which will or might in any way interfere	0	c
with or impede its achievement.	0	s
13.  This Order shall take effect immediately.	0	s
