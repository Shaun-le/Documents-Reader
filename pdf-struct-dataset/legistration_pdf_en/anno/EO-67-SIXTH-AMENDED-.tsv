SIXTH AMENDED NUMBER SIXTY-SEVEN (2020)	0	x
AND	0	x
ORDER OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SEVEN	0	x
PHASE THREE TIGHTENING OF CERTAIN TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS DUE	0	x
TO NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)	0	x
Importance of the Issue	0	d
While the Commonwealth’s case count per capita and positivity rate remain	0	c
comparatively low, all five health regions in the Commonwealth are experiencing increases	0	c
in new COVID-19 cases, positive tests, and hospitalizations. Virginia is averaging 1,500	0	c
new COVID-19 cases per day, up from a statewide peak of approximately 1,200 in May.	0	c
The statewide percent test positivity rate is at 6.5%, an increase from 4.3% approximately	0	c
one month ago. All five health regions report a positivity rate over five percent and	0	c
hospitalizations have increased statewide by more than 35 percent in the last four weeks.	0	c
Case investigation interviews show a pattern of increased socialization with extended (non-	0	c
household) family members and friends. Recent scientific literature suggests indoor	0	c
settings contribute to community transmission. Modeling data demonstrates that large	0	c
gatherings substantially increase transmission of the virus. Although Virginians have done	0	c
much to mitigate the spread of the virus, it is clear that additional measures are necessary.	0	c
Accordingly, I order following additional restrictions.	6	s
