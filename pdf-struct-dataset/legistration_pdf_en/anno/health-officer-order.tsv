UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS	0	c
101040, 101085, AND 120175, THE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA	0	c
(“HEALTH OFFICER”) ORDERS:	0	d
1.  The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in	0	c
their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible, while enabling essential	0	c
services to continue, to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent	0	c
possible.  When people need to leave their places of residence, whether to obtain or	0	c
perform vital services, or to otherwise facilitate authorized activities necessary for	0	c
continuity of social and commercial life, they should at all times reasonably possible	0	c
comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below.  All	0	c
provisions of this Order should be interpreted to effectuate this intent.  Failure to comply	0	c
with any of the provisions of this Order constitutes an imminent threat to public health.	0	s
2.  All individuals currently living within the County of Alameda (the “County”) are ordered	0	c
to shelter at their place of residence.  To the extent individuals are using shared or	0	c
outdoor spaces, they must at all times as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of	0	c
at least six feet from any other person when they are outside their residence.  All persons	0	c
may leave their residences only for Essential Activities, Essential Governmental	0	c
Functions, or to operate Essential Businesses, all as defined in Section 10.  Individuals	0	c
Order of the County Health Officer	0	e
to Shelter in Place	0	e
Page 1 of 7	0	e
experiencing homelessness are exempt from this Section, but are strongly urged to obtain	0	c
shelter, and governmental and other entities are strongly urged to make such shelter	0	c
available as soon as possible and to the maximum extent practicable (and to utilize Social	0	c
Distancing Requirements in their operation).	0	s
3.  All businesses with a facility in the County, except Essential Businesses as defined below	0	c
in Section 10, are required to cease all activities at facilities located within the County	0	c
except Minimum Basic Operations, as defined in Section 10.  For clarity, businesses may	0	c
also continue operations consisting exclusively of employees or contractors performing	0	c
activities at their own residences (i.e., working from home).  All Essential Businesses are	0	c
strongly encouraged to remain open.  To the greatest extent feasible, Essential Businesses	0	c
shall comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below,	0	c
including, but not limited to, when any customers are standing in line.	0	s
4.  All public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a household	0	c
or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes as expressly permitted in	0	c
Section 10.  Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a household or	0	c
living unit.	0	s
5.  All travel, including, but not limited to, travel on foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle,	0	c
automobile, or public transit, except Essential Travel and Essential Activities as defined	0	c
below in Section 10, is prohibited.  People must use public transit only for purposes of	0	c
performing Essential Activities or to travel to and from work to operate Essential	0	c
Businesses or maintain Essential Governmental Functions.  People riding on public	0	c
transit must comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below,	0	c
to the greatest extent feasible.  This Order allows travel into or out of the County to	0	c
perform Essential Activities, operate Essential Businesses, or maintain Essential	0	c
Governmental Functions.	0	s
6.  This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of COVID-19 within the	0	c
County and throughout the Bay Area, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the	0	c
most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally	0	c
and COVID-19 specifically, and evidence that the age, condition, and health of a	0	c
significant portion of the population of the County places it at risk for serious health	0	c
complications, including death, from COVID-19.  Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19	0	c
virus in the general public, which is now a pandemic according to the World Health	0	c
Organization, there is a public health emergency throughout the County.  Making the	0	c
problem worse, some individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms	0	c
or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the virus.	0	c
Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because evidence	0	c
shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable transmission of	0	c
the virus.  The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, it is essential	0	c
to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable and to	0	c
prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed.  One proven way to slow the	0	c
transmission is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable.  By	0	c
Order of the County Health Officer	0	e
to Shelter in Place	0	e
Page 2 of 7	0	e
reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, this Order helps preserve critical and limited	0	c
healthcare capacity in the County.	0	s
7.  This Order also is issued in light of the existence of 15 cases of COVID-19 in the County,	0	c
as well as at least 258 confirmed cases and at least three deaths in the seven Bay Area	0	c
jurisdictions jointly issuing this Order, as of 5 p.m. on March 15, 2020, including a	0	c
significant and increasing number of suspected cases of community transmission and	0	c
likely further significant increases in transmission.  Widespread testing for COVID-19 is	0	c
not yet available but is expected to increase in the coming days.  This Order is necessary	0	c
to slow the rate of spread and the Health Officer will re-evaluate it as further data	0	c
becomes available.	0	s
8.  This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference, the March 4,	0	c
2020 Proclamation of a State of Emergency issued by Governor Gavin Newsom, the	0	c
Declarations of Local Health Emergency issued by the Health Officer on March 1 and 5,	0	c
the March 10, 2020 Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Alameda	0	c
Ratifying the Declarations of Local Health Emergency, and Governor Newsom’s March	0	c
12, 2020 Executive Order N-25-20.	0	s
9.  This Order comes after the release of substantial guidance from the County Health	0	c
Officer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of	0	c
Public Health, and other public health officials throughout the United States and around	0	c
the world, including a variety of prior orders to combat the spread and harms of COVID-	0	c
19.  The Health Officer will continue to assess the quickly evolving situation and may	0	c
modify or extend this Order, or issue additional Orders, related to COVID-19.	0	s
