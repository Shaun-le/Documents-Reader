Bridge Phase Order	0	x
WHEREAS, since early March 2020, Illinois has faced a pandemic that has caused extraordinary	0	c
sickness and loss of life, infecting over 1.35 million residents, and taking the lives of more than	0	c
22,000 residents; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, at  all times but  especially  during  a public health crisis,  protecting the health and	0	c
safety of Illinoisans is among the most important functions of State government; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, social distancing, face coverings, and other public health precautions have proven	0	c
to be critical in slowing and stopping the spread of COVID-19; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially	0	c
severe illness and death; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recently updated its	0	c
guidance for fully vaccinated people,1 indicating that they can resume numerous activities	0	c
without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, except where required by federal, state, local,	0	c
tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance;	0	c
and,	0	s
WHEREAS, the CDC continues to advise that cloth face coverings or masks protect persons	0	c
who are not fully vaccinated from COVID-19; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, the CDC advises that schools continue to use the COVID-19 prevention strategies	0	c
outlined in the CDC’s Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools for at least the remainder of the	0	c
2020-2021 academic school year; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, the CDC continues to advise that day care providers continue to use COVID-19	0	c
prevention strategies, including masking and physical distancing, even after day care providers	0	c
and their staff are vaccinated; and	0	s
WHEREAS, in light of the continued spread of COVID-19 and the significant percentage of the	0	c
population that remains unvaccinated, I declared on April 30, 2021 that the current	0	c
circumstances in Illinois surrounding the spread of COVID-19 constitute an epidemic emergency	0	c
1 Individuals are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, such as the Pfizer or	0	x
Moderna vaccines, or 2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine.	0	x
Individuals who do not meet these requirements, regardless of age, are not considered fully vaccinated.	0	x
1	0	e
and a public health emergency under Section 4 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency	0	c
Act; and,	0	s
WHEREAS, the number of new COVID-19 cases has decreased in recent weeks, and the public	0	c
health metrics now allow for the State to relax some mitigation measures as more residents have	0	c
been vaccinated;	0	s
THEREFORE, by the powers vested in me as the Governor of the State of Illinois, pursuant to	0	c
the Illinois Constitution and Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9), and 7(12) of the Illinois	0	c
Emergency Management Agency Act, 20 ILCS 3305, and consistent with the powers in public	0	c
health laws, I hereby order the following, effective immediately:	0	d
Bridge Phase Order	0	d
1.  Intent of this Executive Order.  The intent of this Executive Order is to safely and	0	c
conscientiously, and in a manner consistent with CDC guidance, expand activities that	0	c
were limited during the prior mitigation Phases of the State’s response to the COVID-19	0	c
pandemic.  This Executive Order supersedes Executive Order 2020-43, as amended by	0	c
Executive Orders 2020-55, 2020-59, and 2021-09.	0	s
2.  Public health requirements for individuals.  Individuals must take the following public	0	c
health steps to protect their own and their neighbors’ health and lives:	0	d
a.  Social distancing.  To the extent individuals who are not fully vaccinated are	0	c
using shared spaces when outside their residence, including when outdoors, they	0	c
must at all times and as much as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of	0	c
at least six feet from any other person who does not live with them.	0	c
b.  Face coverings.2  Any individual who is not fully vaccinated and who is over age	0	c
two and able to medically tolerate a face covering (a mask or cloth face covering)	0	c
shall be required to cover their nose and mouth with a face covering when in a	0	c
public place and unable to maintain a six-foot social distance.  This requirement	0	c
applies whether in an indoor space, such as a store, or in a public outdoor space	0	c
where maintaining a six-foot social distance is not always possible.	0	b
All individuals, including those who are fully vaccinated, shall be required to	0	c
wear a face covering consistent with CDC guidance, including (1) on planes,	0	c
buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation and in transportation hubs	0	c
such as airports and train and bus stations; (2) in congregate facilities such as	0	c
correctional facilities and homeless shelters; and (3) in healthcare settings.	0	b
2 Throughout this Executive Order, any reference to a face covering requirement excludes those two years old and	0	x
younger and those for whom wearing a face covering is not medically advisable.  Guidance on use of face coverings	0	x
from the Illinois Department of Human Rights is available here:	0	x

Coverings_During_COVID-19_Ver_2020511b%20copy.pdf	0	x
2	0	e
Individuals in schools, day care settings, and educational institutions should	0	c
continue to follow separate guidance issued by the Illinois State Board of	0	c
Education, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, and the Illinois	0	c
Department of Public Health.	0	s
c.  Elderly people and those who are vulnerable as a result of illness should take	0	c
additional precautions.  People who are not fully vaccinated and who are at high	0	c
risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including elderly people and those with a	0	c
health condition that may make them vulnerable, are urged to stay in their	0	c
residence and minimize in-person contact with others to the extent possible.	0	s
d.  Gatherings.  Because in-person contact presents the greatest risk of transmission	0	c
of COVID-19, Illinoisans who are not fully vaccinated are encouraged to continue	0	c
limiting in-person contact with others and to expand their social contact	0	c
cautiously.  For residents who are not fully vaccinated, gathering remotely	0	c
continues to be the safest way to interact with those outside a household or	0	c
residence.	0	s
e.  Go outdoors.  Public health guidance suggests that the risks of transmission of	0	c
COVID-19 are greatly reduced outdoors as opposed to indoors.  Where possible,	0	c
Illinoisans who are not fully vaccinated are encouraged to conduct their activities	0	c
outdoors.	50	s
3.  Public health requirements for businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations.  For	0	c
the purposes of this Executive Order, covered businesses include any for-profit, non-	0	c
profit, or educational entity, regardless of the nature of the service, the function it	0	c
performs, or its corporate or entity structure.  Those entities must take the following	0	c
public health measures to protect their employees, their customers, and all others who	0	c
come into physical contact with their operations.  Nothing in this Executive Order	0	c
prevents these entities from undertaking stricter or additional public health measures; to	0	c
the contrary, businesses are encouraged to prioritize the health and safety of their workers	0	c
and customers, and may continue to require face coverings and social distancing, even for	0	c
those who are fully vaccinated.	0	d
a.  Requirements for all businesses.  All businesses must:	0	d
•  ensure that employees who are not fully vaccinated practice social	0	c
distancing and wear face coverings when social distancing is not always	0	c
possible;	0	s
•  ensure that all spaces where employees may gather, including locker	0	c
rooms and lunchrooms, allow for social distancing; and	0	s
•  ensure that all visitors (customers, vendors, etc.) to the workplace who	0	c
are not fully vaccinated can practice social distancing; but if maintaining	0	c
3	0	e
a six-foot social distance will not be possible at all times, encourage	0	c
those visitors to wear face coverings; and	0	s
•  continue to take all necessary steps to protect employees and customers	0	c
by ensuring that any return to work plans adhere to all applicable public	0	c
health guidance.	101	c

meeting spaces can operate in a manner consistent with DCEO guidance.	0	s
f.  Requirements for restaurants and bars.  All businesses that offer food or	0	c
beverages for on-premises consumptionーincluding restaurants, bars, grocery	0	c

encouraged to serve food and beverages so that they may be consumed off-	0	c
premises, as permitted by law, through means such as in-house delivery, third-	0	c
party delivery, drive-through, and curbside pick-up.  Establishments offering food	0	c
or beverages for on-premises consumption or for carry-out must ensure that they	0	c
