personnel do not include visitors to hospitals and long-term care facilities who  are	0	c
granted entry by the facility’s director, or designee, because they are family or friends	0	c
who  are  visiting  a  resident  in  an  end  of  life  or  similar  situation,  are  parents  or	0	c
guardians  visiting  a  child  who  is  a  patient,  or  because  of  any  other  circumstances	0	c

Page 6 of 9	0	e
ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER AND EMERGENCY REGULATIONS	0	e
as best practices as currently known and available to protect vulnerable members of the public	0	c
from avoidable risk of serious illness or death resulting from exposure to COVID-19. The age,	0	c
condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of the county places it at risk	0	c
for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19. Although most individuals	0	c
who  contract  COVID-19  do  not  become  seriously  ill,  persons  with  mild  symptoms  and	0	c
asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other vulnerable members of the publicー	0	c
such as older adults, and those with underlying health conditionsーat significant risk.	0	s
18. The actions required by this Order are necessary to reduce the number of individuals who will	0	c
be exposed to COVID-19, and will thereby slow the spread of COVID-19 in the county. By	0	c
reducing the spread of COVID-19, this Order will help preserve critical and limited healthcare	0	c
capacity in the county and will save lives.	0	s

Californians Healthy and Safe; l) and the California Statewide Public Health Officer Order	0	c
dated August 28, 2020.	0	s
20. This Order is issued to prevent circumstances often present in gatherings that may exacerbate	0	c
the spread of COVID-19, such as: 1) the increased likelihood that gatherings will attract people	0	c
from a broad geographic area; 2) the prolonged time period in which large numbers of people	0	c

Page 7 of 9	0	e
ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER AND EMERGENCY REGULATIONS	0	e
attend a single event or are at a single location; and 4) the inability to ensure that such persons	0	c
follow adequate hygienic practices.	0	s
