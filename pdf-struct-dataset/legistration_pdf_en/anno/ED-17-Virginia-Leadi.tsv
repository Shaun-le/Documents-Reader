Executive Directive Number Seventeen (2021)	0	x
Virginia Leading by Example to Restore the Chesapeake Bay and Its Tributaries	0	x
Importance of the Initiative	0	d
Overwhelming scientific evidence shows us that nutrient and sediment pollution degrade	0	c
water quality and harm living resources. The Commonwealth of Virginia has pursued and	0	c
achieved significant reductions in nutrient and sediment pollution to the Chesapeake Bay and the	0	c
rivers and streams that are tributaries to the Bay.  Despite real progress, continued reductions in	0	c
nutrient and sediment pollution are necessary both to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and	0	c
to meet federal Clean Water Act requirements.	0	s
A restored Chesapeake Bay will make Virginia a more desirable place to live, work, and	0	c
play. It will enhance our state and local economies by supporting tourism, outdoor recreation,	0	c
fisheries, aquaculture, and other sustainable, water-oriented economic development.  Restoration	0	c
work also creates jobs, improves land management, and benefits local communities by making	0	c
them more attractive and resilient places to live.	0	s
In order to meet our commitment to restoring the Bay, the Commonwealth developed a	0	c
Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) to achieve the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum	0	c
Daily Load no later than 2025 while also accounting for the additional pollution loads resulting	0	c
from climate change. The WIP calls for additional actions to reduce nutrient and sediment	0	c
pollution by local governments, homeowners, wastewater treatment facilities, developers and	0	c
farmers.  State agencies and public institutions of higher education that own land in the	0	c
Commonwealth’s Chesapeake Bay watershed must also take action to reduce nutrient and	0	c
sediment pollution.  The Commonwealth therefore committed in the Phase III WIP to develop a	0	c
watershed implementation plan specific to state lands.	3	s
State Lands Watershed Implementation Plan	0	d
The goal of the State Lands Watershed Implementation Plan (SWIP) is to achieve	0	c
significant reductions in, or to offset, unregulated, nonpoint source nutrient and sediment	0	c
pollution originating from the lands and activities of all Virginia agencies, public institutions of	0	c
higher education, and other state governmental entities that own or manage land within	0	c
Virginia’s Chesapeake Bay watershed.	0	s
The SWIP required development of a comprehensive dataset of acreage of state lands	0	c
within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and calculation of pollution load reductions using the	0	c
Chesapeake Bay Watershed model. The SWIP details reduction targets of 122,000 pounds of	0	c
nitrogen and 10,100 pounds of phosphorus.	0	s
To achieve the reduction targets, the SWIP describes 11 programmatic actions:	0	d
1.  Standards for Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry	0	s
2.  Converting Managed Turf to Native Landscapes	0	s
3.  Unregulated Stormwater Runoff from Impervious Surfaces on Developed Land	0	s
4.  Native Habitat Valuation for Human Health, Wildlife, and Water Quality	0	s
5.  Onsite Sewer Systems	0	s
6.  Pilot Fee-for-Documented-Performance Projects	0	s
7.  Community Outreach and Education	0	s
8.  Aligning Habitat Restoration, Resilience, and Water Quality Goals	0	s
9.  Build Water Quality Improvements into Virginia’s Hazard Mitigation Plan	0	s
10. Interagency Technical Support and Collaboration	0	s
11. Clean Water Jobs Training Collaborative	34	b
The SWIP also identifies specific pollutant load reducing practices, treatments, and	0	c
technologies to be implemented between 2021 and 2025 in order to achieve nitrogen,	0	c
phosphorus, and sediment reduction targets by major river basins.	0	s
The SWIP can be found here.	24	s
Directive	0	d
Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as the Chief Executive by Article V	0	c
of the Constitution of Virginia and under the laws of the Commonwealth, I hereby order the	0	c
Secretary of Natural Resources in partnership with the Secretary of Administration, Secretary of	0	c
Public Safety and Homeland Security, and the Conservation Cabinet to ensure that the SWIP is	0	c
fully implemented by all Virginia executive branch agencies, public institutions of higher	0	c
education, and other state governmental entities that own or manage land within Virginia’s	0	c
Chesapeake Bay watershed.	50	s

Effective Date of the Executive Directive	0	d
This Executive Directive shall be effective upon its signing and shall remain in full force	0	c
and effect until amended or rescinded by further executive directive.	0	c

of June, 2021.	0	s
