ORDER NO. 3396	0	x
Subject: Rescission of Secretary’s Order 3388, “Land and Water Conservation Fund	0	c
Implementation by the U.S. Department of the Interior”	0	s
Sec. 1  Purpose.  This Order rescinds Secretary’s Order No. 3388 (SO 3388), entitled “Land and	0	c
Water Conservation Fund Implementation by the U.S. Department of the Interior.”	0	s
Sec. 2  Authority.  This Order is issued under the authority of section 2 of Reorganization Plan	0	c
No. 3 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1262), as amended; the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act	0	c
(Pub. L. 88-578), as amended; the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and	0	c
Recreation Act (Pub. L. 116-9); and the Great American Outdoors Act (Pub. L. 116-152).	0	s
Sec. 3  Background.  On November 9, 2020, former Secretary David L. Bernhardt issued	0	c
SO 3388, unilaterally conditioning the availability of State financial assistance on compliance	0	c
with new policy prerogatives without meaningful consultation with stakeholders or the public.	0	c
SO 3388 also imposed new restrictions not mandated by law on the availability of Land and	0	c
Water Conservation (LWCF) funding for Federal acquisitions of land, water, or interests therein.	0	c
These limitations were imposed immediately after Congress dramatically increased the annual	0	c
funding level of the LWCF to in excess of $900 million. SO 3388 needlessly inhibits availability	0	c
of LWCF funds to State assistance programs and Federal land acquisitions and is not mandated	0	c
by any existing statutory or regulatory requirement.	0	s
Sec. 4  Directive.  SO 3388, “Land and Water Conservation Fund Implementation by the	0	c
U.S. Department of the Interior,” is hereby revoked.	0	s
Sec. 5  Implementation.	0	d
a. The Directors of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau	0	c
of Land Management are directed to:	0	d
1.     Take all necessary actions, unless prohibited by law or regulation, to revise	0	c
guidance for LWCF expenditures to no longer reflect the criteria mandated by SO 3388−this	0	c
includes the revision of alterations that were made solely or primarily on account of such Order.	0	s
2.     Undertake a policy review to determine any appropriate or necessary further	0	c
guidance revisions.	0	s
3.     Carry out LWCF Federal acquisition expenditures consistent with this Order.	25	s
b. The Director of the National Park Service is further directed to:	0	d
1.     Revise the National Park Service Manual, entitled Land and Water	0	c
Conservation Fund Assistance Manual, to no longer reflect the policy prescriptions mandated by	0	c
SO 3388 where alterations were made solely or primarily on account of such Order.	0	s
2.     Undertake a policy review to determine any appropriate or necessary further	0	c
revisions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Assistance Manual.	0	s
3.     Implement the LWCF state assistance program and Outdoor Recreation Legacy	0	c
Partnership Program consistent with this Order.	25	s
Sec. 6  Effect of this Order.  This Order is intended to improve the internal management of the	0	c
Department. This Order and any resulting report or recommendations are not intended to−and do	0	c
not−create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party	0	c
against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or	0	c
employees, or any other person. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the provisions	0	c
of this Order and any Federal laws or regulations, the laws or regulations will control.	0	s
Sec. 7  Expiration Date.  This Order is effective immediately.	0	s
