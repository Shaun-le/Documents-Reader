Executive Order N-09-19	0	x
WHEREAS,  California's death penalty system is unfair, unjust, wasteful,	0	c
protracted and does not make our state safer.	0	s
WHEREAS,  the state's bedrock responsibility to ensure equal justice under	0	c
the law applies to all people no matter their race, mental ability, where they	0	c
live, or how much money they have.	0	s
WHEREAS,  death sentences are unevenly and unfairly applied to people	0	c
of color, people with mental disabilities, and people who cannot afford costly	0	c
legal representation.	0	s
WHEREAS,  innocent people have been sentenced to death in	0	c
California.  Moreover, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that as	0	c
many as one in 25 people sentenced to death in the United States is  likely	0	c
innocent.	0	s
WHEREAS,  since 1978, California has spent $5 billion on a death penalty	0	c
system that has executed  13 people.	0	s
WHEREAS,  no person has been executed since 2006 because California's	0	c
execution protocols have not been lawful. Yet today, 25 California death row	0	c
inmates have exhausted all of their state and federal appeals and could be	0	c
eligible for an execution date.	0	s
WHEREAS,  I will not oversee execution of any person while Governor.	0	s

otherwise alter any current conviction or sentence.	0	s
2.    California's lethal injection protocol shall be repealed.	0	s
3.    The Death Chamber at San Quentin shall be immediately closed in light of	0	c
the foregoing.	27	s
IT IS  FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as hereafter possible, this Order shall	0	c
be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State and that widespread publicity	0	c
and notice shall be given to this Order.	-1	s
This  Order is  not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits,	0	c
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the State of	0	c
California, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees	0	c
