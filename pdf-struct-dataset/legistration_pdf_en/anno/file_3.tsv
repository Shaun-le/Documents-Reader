ORDER	0	d
¶ 1    Held:  The appellate court vacated the circuit court’s turnover order where it failed to	0	c
serve the defendant an order to show cause prior to issuing a body attachment	0	c
order and remanded with directions to return the $150 bond to the third party who	0	c
posted bail funds on the defendant’s behalf.	0	s
¶ 2             Defendant Kristin Carter appeals from the Douglas County circuit court’s order	0	c
(1) turning over to plaintiff, Curtis Root, a $150 bond posted on behalf of Carter and the	0	c
underlying body attachment order that resulted in the posting of that bond and (2) denying her	0	c
motion to reconsider the aforementioned order. Carter argues this court should vacate the court’s	0	c
turnover order and remand the cause with instructions to order the $150 bond be returned to her.	0	c
We vacate the circuit court’s turnover order and remand with directions.	0	s
¶ 3                                          I. BACKGROUND	0	d
¶ 4             In October 2018, Root commenced an eviction proceeding in the Douglas County	0	c
circuit court against Carter, who had rented a home from him in Tuscola, Illinois, where she	0	c
lived with her two dependent children. Appearing pro se at a November 2018 hearing, Carter	0	c
consented to an eviction order and a judgment for $3450.	0	s
¶ 5             Root commenced supplementary collection proceedings in January 2019. At that	0	c
time, Carter was issued a citation to discover assets. Carter appeared for a citation hearing on	0	c
February 28, 2019. According to the docket entry sheet, Carter, after “sworn testimony,” agreed	0	c
to pay $50 per month beginning March 20, 2019. The circuit court ordered Carter to appear on	0	c
May 21, 2019, “for status.” Following the May status hearing, Carter was ordered to appear at	0	c
another status hearing on November 18, 2019.	0	s
¶ 6             Carter failed to appear at the November hearing, and the circuit court, on Root’s	0	c
motion, ordered a body attachment to issue and fixed bond at $1500, “10% rule to apply.” The	0	c
attachment commanded Carter to be arrested and brought to court “to answer to charge for	0	c
contempt of Court.”	0	s
¶ 7             On November 22, 2019, Carter was arrested in Shelby County and taken to jail.	0	c
Later that day, a relative, Sheila Fritts, posted $150 for Carter’s release. Upon her release, Carter	0	c
signed and received a document titled “Other County Bail Bond,” which stated she had been	0	c
“charged with the offense of contempt of court.” The document additionally contained a clause	0	c
titled, “Assignment of Bail Bond by the Defendant.” The clause stated, “I hereby authorize the	0	c
return of monies posted above to the person shown on this bail bond as having provided the	0	c
monies for my bail after all conditions of this bail bond have been met,” under which Carter’s	0	c
signature is visible. Carter was ordered to appear at the Douglas County courthouse on	0	c
December 31, 2019.	0	s
- 2 -	0	e
¶ 8             At the December 2019 hearing, Carter appeared for the first time represented by	0	c
counsel. At the hearing, Carter orally moved for a refund of the $150 bond posted by Fritts.	0	c
Carter argued the court failed to serve her with an order to show cause prior to issuing the body	0	c
attachment in violation of section 12-107.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Procedure Code)	0	c
(735 ILCS 5/12-107.5(a) (West 2018)). Carter further argued, citing Illinois Supreme Court Rule	0	c
277(f) (eff. Jan. 4, 2013), the supplementary proceedings automatically terminated by operation	0	c
of law six months after her initial citation hearing on February 28, 2019. The court found the	0	c
proceeding was not “an extension per se” of the citation hearing, but rather a “review of a	0	c
payment order that was in place,” and therefore the automatic termination provision set forth in	0	c
Rule 277(f) was not applicable. After determining the judgment had not been paid, the court	0	c
denied Carter’s request to be refunded the $150 and ordered the $150 bond be turned over to	0	c
Root.	0	s
¶ 9             Carter filed a motion to reconsider, arguing the court’s issuance of the body	0	c
attachment was improper because it failed to first serve Carter with an order to show cause, and	0	c
it additionally failed to make required statutory findings prior to ordering the $150 be turned	0	c
over to Root. Carter also filed a motion to vacate the payment order, arguing she did not receive	0	c
notice of her right to assert exemptions against certain income or assets as required by statute,	0	c
and because Carter had no nonexempt income or assets with which to pay the $50 monthly	0	c
payments, the payment order must be vacated. At a February 2020 hearing, the court granted	0	c
Carter’s motion to vacate the payment order but denied the motion to reconsider a return of the	0	c
bond money. The court concluded the May 2019 and November 2019 hearings were not a	0	c
continuation of the citation proceedings, but rather periodic reviews of the payment order, and	0	c
therefore Rule 277(f) did not operate to automatically terminate the proceedings. It additionally	0	c
- 3 -	0	e
concluded its order turning over the $150 bond to Root was not improper because “the person	0	c
posting it has not claimed a right.”	0	s
¶ 10            This appeal followed.	34	s
¶ 11                                           II. ANALYSIS	0	d
¶ 12            On appeal, Carter argues this court should vacate the circuit court’s turnover order	0	c
and remand the cause with directions to order the $150 bond be refunded to Carter. Specifically,	0	c
Carter argues (1) the court failed to serve her with an order to show cause prior to issuing the	0	c
body attachment, and therefore her arrest was improper; (2) the court failed to make the requisite	0	c
statutory findings prior to entering the turnover order; (3) the court erroneously determined	0	c
Carter had no right to claim a return of the bond posted by Fritts, and Fritts had not claimed a	0	c
right to the monies; and (4) the November 2019 court date constituted an unauthorized	0	c
continuation of the citation proceeding.	0	s
¶ 13            Prior to addressing Carter’s arguments, we note Root has not filed a brief with	0	c
this court. In First Capitol Mortgage Corp. v. Talandis Construction Corp., 63 Ill. 2d 128, 133,	0	c
345 N.E.2d 493, 495 (1976), the Illinois Supreme Court explained the options available to a	0	c
reviewing court when an appellee does not file a brief:	0	d
“We do not feel that a court of review should be compelled to serve as an	0	c
advocate for the appellee or that it should be required to search the record for the	0	c
purpose of sustaining the judgment of the trial court. It may, however, if justice	0	c
requires, do so. Also, it seems that if the record is simple and the claimed errors	0	c
are such that the court can easily decide them without the aid of an appellee’s	0	c
brief, the court of review should decide the merits of the appeal. In other cases if	0	c
the appellant’s brief demonstrates prima facie reversible error and the contentions	0	c
- 4 -	0	e
of the brief find support in the record the judgment of the trial court may be	0	c
reversed.”	98	b
In other words,	0	d
“[I]n the absence of an appellee’s brief, a reviewing court has three options:	0	c
(1) the court may serve as an advocate for the appellee and decide the case when	0	c
the court determines that justice so requires; (2) the court may decide the merits of	0	c
the case if the record is simple and the issues can be easily decided without the aid	0	c
of an appellee’s brief; or (3) the court may reverse the trial court when the	0	c
appellant’s brief demonstrates prima facie reversible error that is supported by the	0	c
record.” Village of Lake in the Hills v. Niklaus, 2014 IL App (2d) 130654, ¶ 14,	0	c
11 N.E.3d 26.	109	b
For the reasons set forth below, we find Carter’s brief and the record demonstrate prima facie	0	c
reversible error. Accordingly, we vacate the trial court’s judgment and remand with directions.	0	s
¶ 14            The issues presented in this case involve the application of section 12-107.5 of the	0	c
Procedure Code regarding (1) the procedures required to issue a body attachment order to answer	0	c
for a charge of civil contempt and (2) the return of bond money posted by a third party in	0	c
response to an erroneously issued body attachment order. Because these are questions of law, our	0	c
review is de novo. Krautsack v. Anderson, 223 Ill. 2d 541, 553, 861 N.E.2d 633, 643 (2006).	0	s
¶ 15                                        A. Body Attachment	0	d
¶ 16            We first address Carter’s argument the court’s issuance of the body attachment	0	c
order was improper. We agree.	0	s
¶ 17            “[A] writ of body attachment is ‘merely [a] means by which to bring [an] alleged	0	c
contemptor before the court when the failure to comply with an order of the court is the alleged	0	c
- 5 -	0	e
contemptuous behavior.’ ” People v. Thompson, 2012 IL App (3d) 100188, ¶ 21, 966 N.E.2d	0	c
1147 (McDade, J., specially concurring) (quoting Revolution Portfolio, LLC v. Beale, 341 Ill.	0	c
App. 3d 1021, 1026, 793 N.E.2d 900, 904 (2003)). Section 12-107.5 of the Procedure Code	0	c
states:	0	d
“No order of body attachment or other civil order for the incarceration or	0	c
detention of a natural person respondent to answer for a charge of indirect civil	0	c
contempt shall issue unless the respondent has first had an opportunity, after	0	c
personal service of notice *** to appear in court to show cause why the	0	c
respondent should not be held in contempt.” 735 ILCS 5/12-107.5(a) (West	0	c
2018).	134	b
The Procedure Code further provides the notice to the respondent shall be an order to show	0	c
cause. Id. § 12-107.5(b).	0	s
¶ 18            Here, the court’s issuance of the body attachment order was improper because it	0	c
failed to issue an order to show cause prior to issuing the body attachment and set the bond at a	0	c
sum greater than permitted by statute. There is no dispute, and the trial court admitted, it did not	0	c
serve Carter with an order to show cause prior to issuing the body attachment, which specifically	0	c
stated Carter was being commanded to appear “to answer to a charge of contempt of court.”	0	c
Moreover, the body attachment stated bond was to be set in the sum of $1500, “10% rule to	0	c
apply.” The court’s explanation at the hearing on Carter’s motion to reconsider that the body	0	c
attachment “d[id]n’t really say *** what kind of contempt the [previous] judge is referring to” is	0	c
perplexing because it also acknowledged the body attachment was issued due to Carter’s failure	0	c
to appear. The fact the court did not thereafter conduct a contempt hearing does not negate the	0	c
fact it issued a body attachment commanding Carter to appear to answer for a charge of	0	c
- 6 -	0	e
contempt. The court failed to abide by the procedures set forth by statute when it both (1) issued	0	c
the body attachment order without first serving Carter with an order to show cause and (2) set the	0	c
bond at an amount exceeding the maximum sum allowed by statute ($1000). See id. We agree	0	c
with Carter the body attachment order was invalid.	125	s
¶ 19                                         B. Turnover Order	0	d
¶ 20            We turn next to Carter’s argument the court failed to conduct the three-part	0	c
inquiry required by statute before ordering the $150 bond invaded and applied to the judgment.	0	s
¶ 21            Section 12-107.5(e) of the Procedure Code states:	0	d
“Upon discharge of any bond secured by the posting of funds, the funds shall be	0	c
returned to the respondent or other party posting the bond, less applicable fees,	0	c
unless the court after inquiry determines that: (1) the judgment debtor willfully	0	c
has refused to comply with a payment order entered in accordance with Section	0	c
2-1402 or an otherwise validly entered order; (2) the bond money belongs to the	0	c
debtor as opposed to a third party; and (3) that any part of the funds constitute	0	c
non-exempt funds of the judgment debtor, in which case the court may cause the	0	c
non-exempt portion of the funds to be paid over to the judgment creditor.”	0	c
(Emphases added.) Id. § 12-107.5(e).	162	s
¶ 22            Here, the court failed to conduct any inquiry whatsoever prior to ordering Carter’s	0	c
$150 cash bond be applied against the judgment. The Procedure Code specifically directs the	0	c
funds “shall be returned to the respondent *** unless” the court determines the aforementioned	0	c
circumstances are present. (Emphases added.) Id. Moreover, the record clearly shows none of the	0	c
circumstances which would justify turning over the bond to Root were present in this case. First,	0	c
no evidence was presented Carter “willfully *** refused to comply” with her payment order.	0	c
- 7 -	0	e
Additionally, the bond money did not belong to Carter, but rather to Sheila Fritts, the family	0	c
member who posted the funds. Finally, any suggestion the funds provided by Fritts constituted	0	c
nonexempt funds belonging to Carter is contradicted by the court’s statement “it is highly	0	c
unlikely there was nonexempt income coming from [Carter] that the court could have entered [a	0	c
payment] order.”	0	s
¶ 23            Additionally, we find no support for the court’s determination Fritts forfeited her	0	c
claim to a return of the bond money by failing to claim a right to the funds. The Procedure	0	c
Code’s requirement that civil bonds “shall be returned to the respondent or other party posting	0	c
the bond” (id.) clearly contemplates the return of bond funds to third parties and contains no rule	0	c
stating a third party’s failure to intervene in the underlying action in order to recover their funds	0	c
will result in forfeiture of any claim to those funds. The document Fritts signed, titled “Notice to	0	c
Person Providing Bail Money Other Than Defendant,” advised only that the bond could be	0	c
forfeited “if the defendant failed to comply with the conditions of the bond,” and the court “may	0	c
also enter an order to pay costs, attorney’s fees, fines or other purposes authorized.” The notice	0	c
did not warn that a third party’s funds provided for bail could be forfeited to the defendant’s	0	c
creditor or the third party must initiate legal proceedings to secure a refund.	0	s
¶ 24            Although we agree with Carter the court erroneously turned over the $150 cash	0	c
bond to Root, we disagree with her assertion she is the party entitled to the refund. Carter signed	0	c
an assignment of bail bond form authorizing the return of the bond funds to Fritts. Accordingly,	0	c
we conclude the funds should be returned to Fritts. Cf. People v. Kirkpatrick, 240 Ill. App. 3d	0	c
401, 407, 608 N.E.2d 256, 259 (1992) (stating trial court in criminal case had authority under	0	c
statute to direct cash bond refund be paid to the aunt of the defendant’s husband who provided	0	c
funds for bail bond).	0	s
- 8 -	0	e
¶ 25            In sum, the circuit court improperly applied Carter’s $150 cash bond to the	0	c
judgment. We vacate the court’s order applying the bond funds to the judgment and remand with	0	c
directions to refund the $150 cash bond to Fritts. Because we vacate the circuit court’s turnover	0	c
order based on the arguments discussed supra, we need not address Carter’s final argument the	0	c
November 2019 hearing constituted an unauthorized extension of the citation proceeding.	86	s
¶ 26                                        III. CONCLUSION	0	d
¶ 27            For the reasons stated, the turnover order entered against Carter by the Douglas	0	c
County circuit court is hereby set aside, and the cause is remanded with directions to return the	0	c
$150 bond to Sheila Fritts.	0	s
