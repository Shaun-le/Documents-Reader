DIRECTOR’S ORDER	0	c
Re:  Director’s  Second  Amended  Order  for  Social  Distancing,  Facial  Coverings  and  Non-	0	c
Congregating	0	c
I,  Stephanie  McCloud,  Director  of  the  Ohio  Department  of  Health  (ODH),  pursuant  to  the  authority	0	c
granted  to  me  in  R.C.  3701.13  to  “make  special  orders...for  preventing  the  spread  of  contagious  or	0	c
infectious diseases” Order the following to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into the State of Ohio:	0	s
Preamble:  As Governor DeWine announced, the vast majority of health orders -- except some orders	0	c
for safety in congregate living and health settings and some technical matters -- will be rescinded on	0	c
June 2, 2021, at 12:01 AM EDT.  This is designed to give individuals, who have not yet been	0	c
vaccinated, time to get vaccinated before the public health mitigation measures are lifted.  Businesses	0	c
may continue to require mitigation measures (e.g., masking and social distancing) among those	0	c
vaccinated and unvaccinated, and individuals may choose to practice mitigation measures.	0	s
The CDC announced on Thursday, May 13, 2021, a change in its guidance and safety procedures for	0	c
those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  The purpose of this Order is to bring the State of	0	c
Ohio’s health orders into conformity with this new CDC guidance during the time until June 2, 2021.  In	0	c
short, except in certain limited circumstances, fully vaccinated persons may safely do most activities	0	c
without a facial covering and without socially distancing.  Unvaccinated individuals are at a	0	c
significantly higher risk of getting COVID-19 and suffering its devastating toll.  As such, unvaccinated	0	c
individuals should continue to protect themselves using mitigation measures, such as masking and social	0	c
distancing.	0	s
Scientific evidence is clear that vaccinations and facial coverings are the most effective weapons in the	0	c
fight against COVID-19.  Individuals who are fully vaccinated are protected and can start doing most of	0	c
the things they stopped doing because of the pandemic.	0	s
Persons who are not fully vaccinated should continue to wear a mask, socially distance, avoid large	0	c
gatherings, and whenever possible, be outside for activities and gatherings.  Only by vaccination and	0	c
following the basic precautions can we continue to lower the number of COVID-19 cases and save lives.	0	c
The Director’s Order signed August 13, 2020, Requiring the Use of Facial Coverings in Child Education	0	c
Settings remains in effect until June 2, 2021, at 12:01 AM EDT, at which time it is rescinded and	0	c
supersedes any conflict with this Order.  To maintain consistency and model safe behavior for Ohio’s	0	c
students, these changes do not affect the existing order requiring the use of facial coverings and other	0	c
health protocols in our schools.  Only those exemptions listed in the August 13, 2020 Order apply in the	0	c
education settings, while this Order is in effect until June 2, 2021.	0	s

Nothing in this order is intended to interfere with the separation of powers under the Ohio Constitution.	0	c
Businesses must apply exceptions to wearing a mask equally to all persons. This Order does not apply to	0	c
jails, prison facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or adult day services centers for elderly	0	c
adults. This Order is not intended to supersede, supplant, or preempt any order or law of a local	0	c
jurisdiction that is more restrictive than this Order.	0	s

Page 5 of 7	0	e
g.  Students:	0	d
i.    Unless fully vaccinated,  athletes and students involved in extracurricular activities	0	c
whose  exposure  was  not  in  a  classroom  setting,  CDC  continues  to  endorse	0	c
quarantine  for  14  days  and  recognizes  that  any  quarantine  shorter  than  14  days	0	c
balances  [the]  reduced  burden  [of  quarantine]  against  a  small  possibility  of	0	c
spreading the virus [beyond 10 days].  CDC recognizes that reducing the length of	0	c
quarantine may make it easier for people to quarantine by reducing the time they	0	c
cannot play sports. Players, coaches, officials, or other individuals who had close	0	c
contact (within six feet of an infected individual for at least 15 minutes) or who	0	c
had direct physical contact with the person (e.g., who were coughed on or sneezed	0	c
on  by  the  infected  person)  and  who  remain  asymptomatic  may  consider  the	0	c
following to consider stopping quarantine:	0	d
•  After day 10 without testing	0	s
•  After day 7 after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or	0	c
later)	189	s
ii.  However, youth who are not required to quarantine due to exposure occurring in	0	c
a  classroom  setting  under  the  school-based  exposure  guidance  or  are  fully	0	c
vaccinated  are  permitted  to  participate  in  organized  sports  activities  and	0	c
extracurricular  activities  as  long  as  they  remain  symptom  free  and  follow	0	c
applicable guidance.	165	s
12. Testing and Quarantine Following a Known Exposure. In accordance with the May 13, 2021	0	c
guidance  from  the  CDC,  fully  vaccinated  people  can  refrain  from  testing  following  a  known	0	c
exposure to COVID-19 if asymptomatic, with some exceptions for specific settings (ex. testing,	0	c
but  not  quarantine,  is  still  recommended  following  an  exposure  to  someone  with  suspected  or	0	c
confirmed COVID-19 for fully vaccinated residents and employees of correctional and detention	0	c
facilities and homeless shelters).  Fully vaccinated people may refrain from quarantine following	0	c
a known exposure if asymptomatic.	0	s
13. Clarification on Protected Activity.  Other than the Facial Coverings (Masks) requirements of	0	c
this Order, the Social Distancing, Congregating and capacity requirements of this Order do not	0	c
apply to religious observances and First Amendment Activity, including activity of the media, as	0	c
has been the case in Ohio since the beginning of the pandemic.	0	s
14. Duration.  This Order shall be effective retroactive to May 14, 2021 at 4:00 PM EDT  and remains	0	c
in  full  force  and  effect  until  June  2,  2021  at  12:01  AM  EDT  unless  the  Director  of  the  Ohio	0	c
Department of Health rescinds or modifies this Order before that time.	-1	s
Page 6 of 7	0	e
Accordingly,  I  hereby  ORDER  the  Social  Distancing,  Facial  Coverings  and  Non-Congregating	0	c

regarding what services are prohibited under this Order, the Director of Health hereby delegates to local	0	c
health departments the authority to answer questions in writing and consistent with this Order.	0	s
