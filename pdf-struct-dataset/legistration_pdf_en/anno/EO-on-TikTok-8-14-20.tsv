REGARDING THE ACQUISITION OF MUSICAL.LY BY BYTEDANCE LTD.	0	x
     By the authority vested in me as President by the	0	c
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,	0	c
including section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as	0	c
amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. 4565, it is hereby ordered as	0	c
follows:	0	d
     Section 1.  Findings.  (a)  There is credible evidence that	0	c
leads me to believe that ByteDance Ltd., an exempted company with	0	c
limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman	0	c
Islands ("ByteDance"), through acquiring all interests in	0	c
musical.ly, an exempted company with limited liability	0	c
incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Musical.ly"),	0	c
might take action that threatens to impair the national security	0	c
of the United States.  As a result of the acquisition, ByteDance	0	c
merged its TikTok application with Musical.ly's social media	0	c
application and created a single integrated social media	0	c
application; and	0	b
     (b)  Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the	0	c
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et	0	c
seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate	0	c
authority for me to protect the national security in this matter.	0	s
     Sec. 2.  Actions Ordered and Authorized.  On the basis of	0	c
the findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering	0	c
the factors described in subsection (f) of section 721, as	0	c
appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law,	0	c
including section 721, I hereby order that:	0	d
     (a)  The transaction resulting in the acquisition by	0	c
ByteDance of Musical.ly, to the extent that Musical.ly or any of	0	c
its assets is used in furtherance or support of, or relating to,	0	c
Musical.ly's activities in interstate commerce in the United	0	c
States ("Musical.ly in the United States"), is hereby prohibited,	0	c
and ownership by ByteDance of any interest in Musical.ly in the	0	c
United States, whether effected directly or indirectly through	0	c
ByteDance, or through ByteDance's subsidiaries, affiliates, or	0	c
Chinese shareholders, is also prohibited.	0	s
     (b)  In order to effectuate this order, not later than 90	0	c
days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended	0	c
for a period not to exceed 30 days, on such written conditions as	0	c
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)	0	c
may impose, ByteDance, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese	0	c
shareholders, shall divest all interests and rights in:	0	d
          (i)   any tangible or intangible assets or property,	0	c
wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation	0	c
of the TikTok application in the United States, as determined by	0	c
the Committee; and	0	s
          (ii)  any data obtained or derived from TikTok	0	c
application or Musical.ly application users in the United	0	c
States.  Immediately upon divestment, ByteDance shall certify in	0	c
writing to CFIUS that all steps necessary to fully and	0	c
permanently effectuate the actions required under sections 2(a)	0	c
and 2(b) have been completed.	46	s
     (c)  Immediately upon divestment, ByteDance shall certify in	0	c
writing to CFIUS that it has destroyed all data that it is	0	c
required to divest pursuant to section 2(b)(ii), as well as all	0	c
copies of such data wherever located, and CFIUS is authorized to	0	c
require auditing of ByteDance on terms it deems appropriate in	0	c
order to ensure that such destruction of data is complete.	0	s
     (d)  ByteDance shall not complete a sale or transfer under	0	c
section 2(b) to any third party:	0	d
          (i)   until ByteDance notifies CFIUS in writing of the	0	c
intended recipient or buyer; and	0	s
          (ii)  unless 10 business days have passed from the	0	c
notification in section 2(d)(i) and CFIUS has not issued an	0	c
objection to ByteDance.  Among the factors CFIUS may consider in	0	c
reviewing the proposed sale or transfer are whether the buyer or	0	c
transferee:  is a U.S. citizen or is owned by U.S. citizens; has	0	c
or has had a direct or indirect contractual, financial, familial,	0	c
employment, or other close and continuous relationship with	0	c
ByteDance, or its officers, employees, or shareholders; and can	0	c
demonstrate a willingness and ability to support compliance with	0	c
this order.  In addition, CFIUS may consider whether the proposed	0	c
sale or transfer would threaten to impair the national security	0	c
of the United States or undermine the purpose of this order, and	0	c
whether the sale effectuates, to CFIUS's satisfaction and in its	0	c
discretion, a complete divestment of all tangible or intangible	0	c
assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support	0	c
the operation of the TikTok application in the United States.	64	s
     (e)  From the date of this order until ByteDance provides a	0	c
certification of divestment to CFIUS pursuant to section 2(b),	0	c
ByteDance and TikTok Inc., a Delaware corporation, shall certify	0	c
to CFIUS on a weekly basis that they are in compliance with this	0	c
order and include a description of efforts to divest the	0	c
interests and rights described in section 2(b) and a timeline for	0	c
projected completion of remaining actions.	0	s
     (f)  Any transaction or other device entered into or	0	c
employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or	0	c
circumventing this order is prohibited.	0	s
     (g)  Without limitation on the exercise of authority by	0	c
any agency under other provisions of law, and until such time as	0	c
the divestment is completed and verified to the satisfaction of	0	c
CFIUS, CFIUS is authorized to implement measures it deems	0	c
necessary and appropriate to verify compliance with this order	0	c
and to ensure that the operations of the TikTok application are	0	c
carried out in such a manner as to ensure protection of the	0	c
national security interests of the United States.  Such measures	0	c
may include the following:  on reasonable notice to ByteDance and	0	c
TikTok Inc., employees of the United States Government, as	0	c
designated by CFIUS, shall be permitted access, for purposes of	0	c
verifying compliance with this order, to all premises and	0	c
facilities of ByteDance and TikTok Inc., and any of their	0	c
respective subsidiaries, operated in furtherance of the TikTok	0	c
application located in the United States:	0	d
          (i)    to inspect and copy any books, ledgers,	0	c
accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and	0	c
documents in the possession or under the control of ByteDance or	0	c
TikTok Inc., or any of their respective subsidiaries, that	0	c
concern any matter relating to this order;	0	s
          (ii)   to inspect or audit any information systems,	0	c
networks, hardware, software, data, communications, or property	0	c
in the possession or under the control of ByteDance or TikTok	0	c
Inc., or any of their respective subsidiaries; and	0	s
          (iii)  to interview officers, employees, or agents of	0	c
ByteDance or TikTok Inc., or any of their respective	0	c
subsidiaries, concerning any matter relating to this	0	c
order.  CFIUS shall conclude its verification procedures within	0	c
90 days after the certification of divestment is provided to	0	c
CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.	107	s
     (h)  If any provision of this order, or the application of	0	c
any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be	0	c
invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its	0	c
other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not	0	c
be affected thereby.  If any provision of this order, or the	0	c
application of any provision to any person of circumstances, is	0	c
held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural	0	c
requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall	0	c
implement those procedural requirements.	0	d
          (i)  The Attorney General is authorized to take any	0	c
steps necessary to enforce this order.	31	s
     Sec. 3.  Reservation.  I hereby reserve my authority to	0	c
issue further orders with respect to ByteDance, Musical.ly,	0	c
Musical.ly in the United States, and TikTok Inc. as shall in my	0	c
judgment be necessary to protect the national security.	0	s
     Sec. 4.  Publication and Transmittal.  (a)  This order shall	0	c
be published in the Federal Register.	0	b
     (b)  I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to	0	c
transmit a copy of this order to the appropriate parties named in	0	c
section 1 of this order.	0	s
