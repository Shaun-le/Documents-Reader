I.	0	d
The Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Commission")  deems it appropriate and in the	0	c
public  interest that public  administrative  proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted  against	0	c
Bingqing  Yang ("Yang"  or "Respondent")  pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers	0	c
Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act").	15	s
II.	0	d
In anticipation  of the institution  of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer	0	c
of Settlement (the "Offer") which the Commission  has determined to accept.  Solely for the	0	c
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the	0	c
Commission,  or to which the Commission  is a party, and without  admitting  or denying  the findings	0	c
herein, except as to the Commission’s  jurisdiction  over her and the subject matter of these	0	c
proceedings, and the findings  contained in Section III.2. below,  which are admitted, Respondent	0	c
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting  Administrative  Proceedings Pursuant to Section	0	c
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making  Findings,  and Imposing  Remedial	0	c
Sanctions ("Order"), as set forth below.	20	s
III.	0	d
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission  finds that:	0	d
1.       Yang was the founder, Chief Executive Officer and President of Luca International	0	c
Group,  LLC ("Luca") and owned and controlled  Luca Resources Group,  LLC and Luca Energy	0	c
Fund,  LLC. (the "Luca Entities").   Yang and the Luca Entities  served as investment advisers to	0	c
funds through  which investors invested in Luca’s oil and gas development projects.  None of the	0	c
Luca Entities  was registered with the Commission  in any capacity.  Yang, 50 years old, resides in	0	c
China.	0	s
2.      On June 9, 2021,  a final judgment  was entered by consent against Yang	0	c
permanently enjoining  her from future violations  of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities	0	c
Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  ("Exchange	0	c
Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and	0	c
Rule 206(4)-8  thereunder, in the civil  action entitled  Securities and Exchange Commission  v.	0	c
Bingqing  Yang, et al., Civil  Action Number 3:15-cv-03101  CRB, in the United States District	0	c
Court for the Northern District of California.	0	s
3.      The Commission’s  complaint  alleged  that from 2007 until  at least 2014,  Yang,	0	c
through the Luca Entities,  engaged in a fraudulent scheme targeting the Chinese American	0	c
community  as well as investors in Asia to invest in the unregistered offerings of a series of	0	c
investment funds controlled  by Yang.  Yang deceived investors that the Luca Entities’  operations	0	c
were successful, and she guaranteed inflated  returns.  To prevent the scheme from collapsing,	0	c
Yang commingled  investor funds and used new investor money to continue making  sham profit	0	c
payments to earlier investors.	30	s
IV.	0	d
In view of the foregoing,  the Commission  deems it appropriate and in the public  interest to	0	c
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Yang’s Offer.	0	s
Accordingly,  it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act,	0	c
effective immediately,  that Respondent Yang be, and hereby is barred from association with any	0	c
broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal  securities dealer, municipal  advisor, transfer agent, or	0	c
nationally  recognized  statistical rating organization.	0	s
Any reapplication  for association by the Respondent will  be subject to the applicable  laws	0	c
and regulations  governing  the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned  upon a number of	0	c
factors, including,  but not limited  to, compliance with the Commission’s  order and payment of any	0	c
or all of the following:   (a) any disgorgement  or civil  penalties ordered by a Court against the	0	c
Respondent in any action brought by the Commission;  (b) any disgorgement  amounts ordered	0	c
2	0	e
against the Respondent for which the Commission  waived payment;  (c) any arbitration award	0	c
related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission  order; (d) any self-regulatory	0	c
organization  arbitration  award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as	0	c
the basis for the Commission  order; and (e) any restitution  order by a self-regulatory organization,	0	c
whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission  order.	0	s
By the Commission.	0	x
